Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9.

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty α= 0.6[38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37].

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

For one, it gave me my second book.

When I was younger, I used to look at the reservation  \\nchart stuck outside my train bogie to check out all the female passengers near  \\nmy seat (F-17 to F-25)is what I’d look for most). Yet, it never happened. In  \\nmost cases I shard my compartment with talkative aunties, snoring men and  \\nwailing infants.\\nBut this night was different. First, my compartment was empty. The  \\nRailways bad just started this new summer train and nobody knew about it.  \\nSecond, I was unable to sleep.\\nI had been to IIT Kanpur for a talk. Before leaving, I drank four cups of  \\ncoffee in the canteen while chatting with students. Bad idea, given that it was  \\ngoing to be boring to spend eight insomniac hours in an empty compartment. I  \\nhad no magazines or books to read. I could hardly see anything out of the  \\nwindow in the darkness. I prepared myself for a silent and dull night. It was  \\nanything but that. \\nShe walked in five minutes after the train bad left the station. She  \\nopened the curtain of my enclosure and looked puzzled. \\n‘Is coach A4, seat 63 here?’ she said.\\nThe yellow light bulb in my compartment was a moody one. It flickered  \\nas I looked up at her.\\n‘Hub…’ I said when I saw her face. It was difficult to withdraw from the  \\ngaze of her eyes.\\n‘Actually it is. My seat is right in front of you,’ she answered her own  \\nquestion and heaved her heavy suitcase onto the upper berth. She sat down  \\non the berth opposite me, and gave out a sigh of relief.\\n‘I climbed onto the wrong coach. Luckily the bogies are connected,’ she  \\nsaid, adjusting her long hair that ended n countless ringlets. From the corner  \\nof my eye I tried to look at her. She was young, perhaps early to mid-\\ntwenties. Her waist-length hair had a life of its own: a strand fell on her  \\nforehead repeatedly. I could no see her face clearly, but I could tell one thing\\n—she was pretty. And her eyes—once you looked into them, you could not  \\nturn away. I kept my gaze down.\\nShe re-arranged stuff in her handbag. I tried to look out of the window.  \\nIt was completely dark.\\n‘So, pretty empty train,’ she said after ten minutes.\\n‘Yes,’ I said. ‘It’s the new holiday special. They just started it, without  \\ntelling people about it.’\\n‘No wonder.

Yeah, just all right… okay okay types,’ she said.\\nI kept quiet. She noticed the expression of mild disappointment on my  \\nface.\\n‘Anyways, nice to meet you Chetan. Where are you coming from? IIT  \\nKanpur?’\\n‘Yes,’ I said, my voice less friendly than a few moments ago. ‘I had to  \\ngive a talk there.’\\n‘Oh really? About what?’\\n‘About my book—you know the just okay-okay type one. Some people do  \\nwant to hear about it,’ I said, keeping a sweet tone to sugarcoat my sarcasm-\\nfilled words.\\n‘Interesting,’ she said and turned quite again.\\nI was quite too. I didn’t want to speak to her anymore. I wanted my  \\nempty compartment back.\\nThe flickering yellow light above was irritating me. I wondered if I  \\nshould just shut it off, but it was not that Late yet.\\n‘What’s the next station?

The moment the bus reached the highway, she learned on  \\nmy shoulder and slept off. My shoulder cramped and my body turned sore.

Mocha’s décor had a  \\nMiddle Eastern twist, with hookahs, velvet cushions and colored glass lamps  \\neverywhere.  Many  of  the  tables  were  occupied  by  couples,  sitting  with  \\nintertwined fingers, obviously deeply in love. The girls laughed at whatever  \\nthe guys said. The guys ordered the most expensive items on the menu. Every  \\nnow  and  then  their eyes  needed  to be  happy  was each  other.  The silly  \\ndelusion in the initial stage of a relationship: aren’t they amazing? \\nMy life was nowhere near perfect, of course. For starters, my girlfriend,  \\nif I could still call her that, was late. Plus, I could sense she was itching to  \\ndump me. Priyanka and I had ended eight of our last ten calls with someone  \\nhanging up the phone on the other.\\nI had not slept the entire day, which is not a big deal for most people,  \\nbut considering I work all night, it had no left me feeling too good. My job was  \\ngoing nowhere, with Bakshi bent on sucking every last drop of my blood.  \\nMaybe he was right—I just did not have the strategic vision or managerial  \\nleadership or whatever crap things you are supposed to have to do well in  \\nlife. Maybe Priyanka’s mom was right too—her daughter was stuck with a  \\nloser.\\nThese  thoughts  enveloped  me  as  she  came  in.  She  had  just  had  a  \\nhaircut. Her waist-length hair was now just a few inches below her shoulders.  \\nI liked her with long hair, but she never listened to me. I told you, I didn’t  \\nhave the leadership skills to influence anyone. Anyway, her hair still looked  \\nnice. She wore a white linen top and a flowing lavender skirt with lost of  \\ncrinkly edges. She had on a thin silver necklace, with the world’s tiniest  \\ndiamond pendant handing from it. I started at my watch as a sign of protest.\\n‘Sorry, Shyam,’ she said as she put a giant brown bag on the table, ‘that  \\nass hairdresser took so long. I told him I had to leave early.’\\n‘No big deal. A haircut has to be more important than me,’ I said,  \\nwithout any emotion in my voice.\\n‘I thought we said no sarcasm,’ she said, ‘and I did say sorry.’\\n‘That’s right. Once sorry for half an hour seems fair, in fact, go get a  \\ntwo-hour facial done as well. You can come back and say sorry four times.’\\n‘Shyam, please. I know I’m late. We promised not to fight.

Radhika and Esha shrugged their shoulders;  \\nshe wasn’t in there.\\nSomeone came up from behind and hugged me.\\n‘I told you we didn’t want to buy anything. Why are you bothering us?’\\nI turned around to look at Priyanka.\\n‘I don’t know what I was doing at the water cooler,’ I said.\\n‘Shut up and hug me,’ Priyanka said and opened her arms.\\nOur eyes met, and even though I wanted to speak a lot, our eyes did al  \\nthe talking. I hugged her for a few seconds, and then she kissed me. Our lips  \\nlocked, and every passenger stuck in the traffic jam looked at us, enjoying  \\nthe early morning show. It was awkward to kiss in this setting, but I could not  \\nextract myself from her. We were kissing after six months, and there was a  \\nlot of pent-up demand. Vroom and everyone else from the Qualis surrounded  \\nus. Soon, they began to clap and whistle. The vehicles on the road joined in  \\nwith their horns in sync with the applause.

We did not know  \\nwhat, how or when things would happen in the future. And to some extent,  \\nwe still don’t know. But that is what life is like—uncertain, screwed up at  \\ntimes, but still fun. However, let me tell you where we were one month after  \\nthis night. Vroom and I started this website design company with the seed  \\ncapital  that  Bakshi  gave  us.  We  called  it  the  Black  Sheep  Web  Design  \\nCompany. In a month, we had only managed to get one local order. It helped  \\nus break even or even show a profit—depending on whether Vroom charged  \\nthe cigarettes to the company or not. No international orders yet, but we  \\nshall see.\\nEsha quit her modeling aspirations and continued to work at the call  \\ncenter. However, she works with this NGO during the day. Her job is to  \\nfundraise  with  corporate.  I  heard  she  is  doing  well.  I  guess  when  male  \\nexecutives hear such a hot woman ask for money for a good cause, they  \\ncannot say no. most of them are probably staring at her navel ring when they  \\nare signing the cheque. Apart from that, Vroom asked her out on a coffee  \\nsemi-date (whatever that means) for next week and I think she said yes. \\nMilitary Uncle got a visa for the US and went to make amends with his  \\nson. He has not come back, so things must be working out. Radhika is fighting  \\nher divorce case with her husband, and has moved in with Esha. She is also  \\nplanning to visit her parents for a while. Anuj has apologized, but Radhika is  \\nin no mood to relent yet.\\nPriyanka works at Connexions as well, but in six months she will go to  \\ncollege for an accelerated one0-year B.Ed. We decided that marriage is at  \\nleast two years away. Right now, we meet often but the first focus is career.  \\nHer mother faked three heart attacks when Priyanka said no to Ganesh, but  \\nPriyanka yawned every single time until her mom gave up on the heart attack  \\nfront and closed the Ganesh file.\\nSo looks like things are working out. As for me as a person, I still feel  \\nthe same for the most part. However, there is a difference. I used to feel I  \\nwas a good-for-nothing non-achiever. But that is not true. After all, I helped  \\nsave lots of jobs at a call center, taught my boss a lesson, started my own  \\ncompany, was chosen over a big-catch NRI groom by a wonderful girl and now  \\nI even finished a whole book. this means that i) I can do whatever I really  \\nwant ii) God is always with me and iii) there is no such thing as a loser after  \\nall.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

I did know about call centers, mostly from my cousins  \\nwho worked there.\\n“Yes, I know a little bit,’ I said. ‘Some 300,000 people work in the  \\nindustry. They help US companies in the sales, service and maintenance of  \\ntheir operations. Usually younger people work there in night shifts. Quite  \\ninteresting, actually.’\\n‘Just interesting? Have you ever thought of what all they have to face?’  \\nshe asked, her voice turning firm again.\\n“Uh, not really…’ I said.\\n‘Why? They aren’t the youth? You don’t want to write about them?’ she  \\nsaid, almost scolding me.\\n‘Listen, let’s not start arguing again…’\\n‘I’m not arguing. I told you that I have a call center story for you.’\\nI looked at my watch. It was 12.30 a.m. A story would not be such a bad  \\nides to kill time, I thought. \\n‘Let’s hear it then, I said.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2410, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.7730361473597844)], metadata={'68846d5f-d4fd-43aa-989e-477f35242528': {'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'one-night-at-the-call-center-all-chapters.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\visionet\\\\programs\\\\openAI RAG\\\\data\\\\one-night-at-the-call-center-all-chapters.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 682496, 'creation_date': '2024-03-10', 'last_modified_date': '2021-03-09'}, '378f6f0a-8bc2-4792-877a-f281dd80ae87': {'page_label': '5', 'file_name': 'one-night-at-the-call-center-all-chapters.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\visionet\\\\programs\\\\openAI RAG\\\\data\\\\one-night-at-the-call-center-all-chapters.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 682496, 'creation_date': '2024-03-10', 'last_modified_date': '2021-03-09'}})"
