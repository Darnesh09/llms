Vision Library \\n(OpenCV) and also provides a general background to the fi  eld of computer vision suf-\\nfi cient to use OpenCV eff  ectively.\\nPurpose\\nComputer vision is a rapidly growing field, partly as a result of both cheaper and more \\ncapable cameras, partly because of affordable processing power, and partly because vi-sion algorithms are starting to mature. OpenCV itself has played a role in the growth of computer vision by enabling thousands of people to do more productive work in vision. With its focus on real-time vision, OpenCV helps students and professionals efficiently implement projects and jump-start research by providing them with a computer vision and machine learning infrastructure that was previously available only in a few mature research labs. The purpose of this text is to:\\nBetter document OpenCV—detail what function calling conventions really mean • \\nand how to use them correctly.\\nRapidly give the reader an intuitive understanding of how the vision algorithms • \\nwork.Give the reader some sense of what algorithm to use and when to use it.• \\nGive the reader a boost in implementing computer vision and machine learning algo-• \\nrithms by providing many working coded examples to start from.Provide intuitions about how to fix some of the more advanced routines when some-• \\nthing goes wrong.\\nSimply put, this is the text the authors wished we had in school and the coding reference \\nbook we wished we had at work.\\nThis book documents a tool kit, OpenCV , that allows the reader to do interesting and \\nfun things rapidly in computer vision. It gives an intuitive understanding as to how the algorithms work, which serves to guide the reader in designing and debugging vision \\nFM-R4886-AT1.indd   ixFM-R4886-AT1.indd   ix 9/15/08   4:26:41 PM9/15/08   4:26:41 PMx | Preface  applications and also to make the formal descriptions of computer vision and machine \\nlearning algorithms in other texts easier to comprehend and remember.\\nAft er all, it is easier to understand complex algorithms and their associated math when \\nyou start with an intuitive grasp of how those algorithms work.\\nWho This Book Is For\\nThis book contains descriptions, working coded examples, and explanations of the com-\\nputer vision tools contained in the OpenCV library. As such, it should be helpful to many different kinds of users.\\nProfessionals\\nFor those practicing professionals who need to rapidly implement computer vision \\nsystems, the sample code provides a quick framework with which to start. Our de-scriptions of the intuitions behind the algorithms can quickly teach or remind the reader how they work.\\nStudents\\nAs we said, this is the text we wish had back in school. The intuitive explanations, detailed documentation, and sample code will allow you to boot up faster in com-puter vision, work on more interesting class projects, and ultimately contribute new research to the field.\\nTeachers\\nComputer vision is a fast-moving field. We’ve found it effective to have the students rapidly cover an accessible text while the instructor fills in formal exposition where needed and supplements with current papers or guest lecturers from experts. The stu-dents can meanwhile start class projects earlier and attempt more ambitious tasks.\\nHobbyists\\nComputer vision is fun, here’s how to hack it.\\nWe have a strong focus on giving readers enough intuition, documentation, and work-ing code to enable rapid implementation of real-time vision applications.\\nWhat This Book Is Not\\nThis book is not a formal text. We do go into mathematical detail at various points,* but it is all in the service of developing deeper intuitions behind the algorithms or to make clear the implications of any assumptions built into those algorithms. We have not attempted a formal mathematical exposition here and might even incur some wrath along the way from those who do write formal expositions.\\nThis book is not for theoreticians because it has more of an “applied” nature. The book \\nwill certainly be of general help, but is no t aimed at any of the specialized niches in com-\\nputer vision (e.g., medical imaging or remote sensing analysis).\\n* Always with a warning to more casual users that they may skip such sections.\\nFM-R4886-AT1.indd   xFM-R4886-AT1.indd   x 9/15/08   4:26:41 PM9/15/08   4:26:41 PMPreface | xiTh at said, it is the belief of the authors that having read the explanations here fi  rst, a stu-\\ndent will not only learn the theory better but remember it longer. Th  erefore, this book \\nwould make a good adjunct text to a theoretical course and would be a great text for an \\nintroductory or project-centric course.\\nAbout the Programs in This Book\\nAll the program examples in this book are based on OpenCV version 2.0. The code should definitely work under Linux or Windows and probably under OS-X, too. Source code for the examples in the book can be fetched from this book’s website ( http://www.oreilly\\n.com/catalog/9780596516130). OpenCV can be loaded from its source forge site \\n(http://\\nsourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary).\\nOpenCV is under ongoing development, with offi   cial releases occurring once or twice \\na year. As a rule of thumb, you should obtain your code updates from the source forge \\nCVS server ( http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=22870 ).\\nPrerequisites\\nFor the most part, readers need only know how to program in C and perhaps some C++. Many of the math sections are optional and are labeled as such. The mathematics in-volves simple algebra and basic matrix algebra, and it assumes some familiarity with solu-tion methods to least-squares optimization problems as well as some basic knowledge of Gaussian distributions, Bayes’ law, and derivatives of simple functions.\\nTh e math is in support of developing intuition for the algorithms. Th  e reader may skip \\nthe math  and the algorithm descriptions, using only the function defi  nitions and code \\nexamples to get vision applications up and running.\\nHow This Book Is Best Used\\nThis text need not be read in order. It can serve as a kind of user manual: look up the func-\\ntion when you need it; read the function’s description if you want the gist of how it works “under the hood” . The intent of this book is more tutorial, however. It gives you a basic understanding of computer vision along with details of how and when to use selected algorithms.\\nThis book was written to allow its use as an adjunct or as a primary textbook for an un-\\ndergraduate or graduate course in computer vision. The basic strategy with this method is for students to read the book for a rapid overview and then supplement that reading with more formal sections in other textbooks and with papers in the field. There are exercises at the end of each chapter to help test the student’s knowledge and to develop further intuitions.\\nY ou could approach this text in any of the following ways.\\nFM-R4886-AT1.indd   xiFM-R4886-AT1.indd   xi 9/15/08   4:26:41 PM9/15/08   4:26:41 PMxii | Preface  Grab Bag\\nGo through Chapters 1–3 in the first sitting, then just hit the appropriate chapters or \\nsections as you need them. This book does not have to be read in sequence, except for Chapters 11 and 12 (Calibration and Stereo).\\nGood Progress\\nRead just two chapters a week until you’ve covered Chapters 1–12 in six weeks (Chap-ter 13 is a special case, as discussed shortly). Start on projects and start in detail on selected areas in the field, using additional texts and papers as appropriate.\\nThe Sprint\\nJust cruise through the book as fast as your comprehension allows, covering Chapters 1–12. Then get started on projects and go into detail on selected areas in the field us-ing additional texts and papers. This is probably the choice for professionals, but it might also suit a more advanced computer vision course.\\nChapter 13 is a long chapter that gives a general background to machine learning in addi-tion to details behind the machine learning algorithms implemented in OpenCV and how to use them. Of course, machine learning is integral to object recognition and a big part of computer vision, but it’s a field worthy of its own book. Professionals should find this text a suitable launching point for further explorations of the literature—or for just getting down to business with the code in that part of the library. This chapter should probably be considered optional for a typical computer vision class.\\nTh is is how the authors like to teach computer vision: Sprint through the course content \\nat a level where the students get the gist of how things work; then get students started \\non meaningful class projects while the instructor supplies depth and formal rigor in selected areas by drawing from other texts or papers in the fi  eld. Th  is same method \\nworks for quarter, semester, or two-term classes. Students can get quickly up and run-ning with a general understanding of their vision task and working code to match. As they begin more challenging and time-consuming projects, the instructor helps them develop and debug complex systems. For longer courses, the projects themselves can become instructional in terms of project management. Build up working systems fi  rst; \\nrefi ne them with more knowledge, detail, and research later. Th  e goal in such courses is \\nfor each project to aim at being worthy of a conference publication and with a few proj-ect papers being published subsequent to further (postcourse) work.\\nConventions Used in This Book\\nThe following typographical conventions are used in this book:\\nItalic \\nIndicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, file extensions, path names, \\ndirectories, and Unix utilities. \\nConstant width\\nIndicates commands, options, switches, variables, attributes, keys, functions, types, classes, namespaces, methods, modules, properties, parameters, values, objects, \\nFM-R4886-AT1.indd   xiiFM-R4886-AT1.indd   xii 9/15/08   4:26:41 PM9/15/08   4:26:41 PMPreface | xiiievents, event handlers, XMLtags, HTMLtags, the contents of files, or the output from \\ncommands. \\nConstant width bold\\nShows commands or other text that should be typed literally by the user.

Th  e list of contributors to this library is far too long to list here, but see the \\n.../opencv/docs/HTML/Contributors/doc_contributors.html fi  le that ships with OpenCV.\\nThanks for Help on OpenCV\\nIntel is where the library was born and deserves great thanks for supporting this project the whole way through. Open source needs a champion and enough development sup-port in the beginning to achieve critical mass. Intel gave it both. There are not many other companies where one could have started and maintained such a project through good times and bad. Along the way, OpenCV helped give rise to—and now takes (optional) advantage of—Intel’s Integrated Performance Primitives, which are hand-tuned assembly language routines in vision, signal processing,  speech, linear algebra, and more. Thus the \\nlives of a great commercial product and an open source product are intertwined.\\nMark Holler, a research manager at Intel, allowed OpenCV to get started by knowingly \\nturning a blind eye to the inordinate amount of time being spent on an unofficial project back in the library’s earliest days. As divine reward, he now grows wine up in Napa’s Mt. Vieder area. Stuart Taylor in the Performance Libraries group at Intel enabled OpenCV by letting us “borrow” part of his Russian software team. Richard Wirt was key to its continued growth and survival. As the first author took on management responsibility at Intel, lab director Bob Liang let OpenCV thrive; when Justin Rattner became CTO, we were able to put OpenCV on a more firm foundation under Software Technology Lab—supported by software guru Shinn-Horng Lee and indirectly under his manager, Paul Wiley. Omid Moghadam helped advertise OpenCV in the early days. Mohammad Haghighat and Bill Butera were great as technical sounding boards. Nuriel Amir, Denver \\nFM-R4886-AT1.indd   xivFM-R4886-AT1.indd   xiv 9/15/08   4:26:42 PM9/15/08   4:26:42 PMPreface | xvDash, John Mark Agosta, and Marzia Polito were of key assistance in launching the ma-\\nchine learning library. Rainer Lienhart, Jean-Yves Bouguet, Radek Grzeszczuk, and Ara Nefian were able technical contributors to OpenCV and great colleagues along the way; the first is now a professor, the second is now making use of OpenCV in some well-known Google projects, and the others are staffing research labs and start-ups. There were many other technical contributors too numerous to name.\\nOn the software side, some individuals stand out for special mention, especially on the \\nRussian software team. Chief among these is the Russian lead programmer Vadim Pisare-vsky, who developed large parts of the library and also managed and nurtured the library through the lean times when boom had turned to bust; he, if anyone, is the true hero of the library. His technical insights have also been of great help during the writing of this book. Giving him managerial support and protection in the lean years was Valery Kuriakin, a man of great talent and intellect. Victor Eruhimov was there in the beginning and stayed through most of it. We thank Boris Chudinovich for all of the contour components.\\nFinally, very special thanks go to Willow Garage [WG], not only for its steady fi  nancial \\nbacking to OpenCV’s future development but also for supporting one author (and pro-\\nviding the other with snacks and beverages) during the fi  nal period of writing this book.\\nThanks for Help on the Book\\nWhile preparing this book, we had several key people contributing advice, reviews, and suggestions. Thanks to John Markoff, Technology Reporter at the New York Times for encouragement, key contacts, and general writing advice born of years in the trenches. To our reviewers, a special thanks go to Evgeniy Bart, physics postdoc at CalTech, who made many helpful comments on every chapter; Kjerstin Williams at Applied Minds, who did detailed proofs and verification until the end; John Hsu at Willow Garage, who went through all the example code; and Vadim Pisarevsky, who read each chapter in de-tail, proofed the function calls and the code, and also provided several coding examples. There were many other partial reviewers. Jean-Yves Bouguet at Google was of great help in discussions on the calibration and stereo chapters. Professor Andrew Ng at Stanford University provided useful early critiques of the machine learning chapter. There were numerous other reviewers for various chapters—our thanks to all of them. Of course, any errors result from our own ignorance or misunderstanding, not from the advice we received.\\nFinally, many thanks go to our editor, Michael Loukides, for his early support, numer-\\nous edits, and continued enthusiasm over the long haul.\\nGary Adds . . .\\nWith three young kids at home, my wife Sonya put in more work to enable this book than I did. Deep thanks and love—even OpenCV gives her recognition, as you can see in the face detection section example image. Further back, my technical beginnings started with the physics department at the University of Oregon followed by undergraduate years at \\nFM-R4886-AT1.indd   xvFM-R4886-AT1.indd   xv 9/15/08   4:26:42 PM9/15/08   4:26:42 PMxvi | Preface  UC Berkeley. For graduate school, I’ d like to thank my advisor Steve Grossberg and Gail \\nCarpenter at the Center for Adaptive Systems, Boston University, where I first cut my academic teeth. Though they focus on mathematical modeling of the brain and I have ended up firmly on the engineering side of AI, I think the perspectives I developed there have made all the difference. Some of my former colleagues in graduate school are still close friends and gave advice, support, and even some editing of the book: thanks to Frank Guenther, Andrew Worth, Steve Lehar, Dan Cruthirds, Allen Gove, and Krishna Govindarajan.\\nI specially thank Stanford University, where I’m currently a consulting professor in the \\nAI and Robotics lab. Having close contact with the best minds in the world definitely rubs off, and working with Sebastian Thrun and Mike Montemerlo to apply OpenCV on Stanley (the robot that won the $2M DARPA Grand Challenge) and with Andrew Ng on STAIR (one of the most advanced personal robots) was more technological fun than a person has a right to have. It’s a department that is currently hitting on all cylinders and simply a great environment to be in. In addition to Sebastian Thrun and Andrew Ng there, I thank Daphne Koller for setting high scientific standards, and also for letting me hire away some key interns and students, as well as Kunle Olukotun and Christos Kozy-rakis for many discussions and joint work. I also thank Oussama Khatib, whose work on control and manipulation has inspired my current interests in visually guided robotic manipulation. Horst Haussecker at Intel Research was a great colleague to have, and his own experience in writing a book helped inspire my effort.\\nFinally, thanks once again to Willow Garage for allowing me to pursue my lifelong ro-\\nbotic dreams in a great environment featuring world-class talent while also supporting my time on this book and supporting OpenCV itself.\\nAdrian Adds . . .\\nComing from a background in theoretical physics, the arc that brought me through su-percomputer design and numerical computing on to machine learning and computer vi-sion has been a long one. Along the way, many individuals stand out as key contributors. I have had many wonderful teachers, some formal instructors and others informal guides. I should single out Professor David Dorfan of UC Santa Cruz and Hartmut Sadrozinski of SLAC for their encouragement in the beginning, and Norman Christ for teaching me the fine art of computing with the simple edict that “if you can not make the computer do it, you don’t know what you are talking about” . Special thanks go to James Guzzo, who let me spend time on this sort of thing at Intel—even though it was miles from what I was sup-posed to be doing—and who encouraged my participation in the Grand Challenge during those years. Finally, I want to thank Danny Hillis for creating the kind of place where all of this technology can make the leap to wizardry and for encouraging my work on the book while at Applied Minds.\\nI also would like to thank Stanford University for the extraordinary amount of support I \\nhave received from them over the years.

Th  e library is written in C \\nand C++ and runs under Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. Th  ere is active development \\non interfaces for Python, Ruby, Matlab, and other languages.\\nOpenCV was designed for computational effi   ciency and with a strong focus on real-\\ntime applications. OpenCV is written in optimized C and can take advantage of mul-\\nticore processors. If you desire further automatic optimization on Intel architectures [Intel], you can buy Intel’s Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP) libraries [IPP], which consist of low-level optimized routines in many diff  erent algorithmic areas. OpenCV \\nautomatically uses the appropriate IPP library at runtime if that library is installed.\\nOne of OpenCV’s goals is to provide a simple-to-use computer vision infrastructure \\nthat helps people build fairly sophisticated vision applications quickly. Th  e OpenCV \\nlibrary contains over 500 functions that span many areas in vision, including factory product inspection, medical imaging, security, user interface, camera calibration, stereo vision, and robotics. Because computer vision and machine learning oft  en go hand-in-\\nhand, OpenCV also contains a full, general-purpose Machine Learning Library (MLL). Th is sublibrary is focused on statistical pattern recognition and clustering. Th  e MLL is \\nhighly useful for the vision tasks that are at the core of OpenCV’s mission, but it is gen-eral enough to be used for any machine learning problem.\\nWho Uses OpenCV?\\nMost computer scientists and practical programmers are aware of some facet of the role that computer vision plays. But few people are aware of all the ways in which computer vision is used. For example, most people are somewhat aware of its use in surveillance, and many also know that it is increasingly being used for images and video on the Web. A few have seen some use of computer vision in game interfaces. Yet few people realize that most aerial and street -map images ( such as in Google’ s Street View ) make heavy \\n01-R4886-RC1.indd   101-R4886-RC1.indd   1 9/15/08   4:17:45 PM9/15/08   4:17:45 PM2 | Chapter 1: Overviewuse of camera calibration and image stitching techniques. Some are aware of niche ap-\\nplications in safety monitoring, unmanned fl  ying vehicles, or biomedical analysis. But \\nfew are aware how pervasive machine vision has become in manufacturing: virtually everything that is mass-produced has been automatically inspected at some point using computer vision.\\nTh e open source license for OpenCV has been structured such that you can build a \\ncommercial product using all or part of OpenCV. You are under no obligation to open-\\nsource your product or to return improvements to the public domain, though we hope you will. In part because of these liberal licensing terms, there is a large user commu-nity that includes people from major companies (IBM, Microsoft  , Intel, SONY, Siemens, \\nand Google, to name only a few) and research centers (such as Stanford, MIT, CMU, Cambridge, and INRIA). Th  ere is a Yahoo groups forum where users can post questions \\nand discussion at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenCV ; it has about 20,000 members. \\nOpenCV is popular around the world, with large user communities in China, Japan, Russia, Europe, and Israel.\\nSince its alpha release in January 1999, OpenCV has been used in many applications, \\nproducts, and research eff  orts. Th  ese applications include stitching images together in \\nsatellite and web maps, image scan alignment, medical image noise reduction, object analysis, security and intrusion detection systems, automatic monitoring and safety sys-tems, manufacturing inspection systems, camera calibration, military applications, and unmanned aerial, ground, and underwater vehicles. It has even been used in sound and music recognition, where vision recognition techniques are applied to sound spectro-gram images. OpenCV was a key part of the vision system in the robot from Stanford, “Stanley”, which won the $2M DARPA Grand Challenge desert robot race [Th  run06].\\nWhat Is Computer Vision?\\nComputer vision* is the transformation of data from a still or video camera into either a decision or a new representation. All such transformations are done for achieving some particular goal. Th  e input data may include some contextual information such as “the \\ncamera is mounted in a car” or “laser range fi  nder indicates an object is 1 meter away”. \\nTh e decision might be “there is a person in this scene” or “there are 14 tumor cells on \\nthis slide”. A new representation might mean turning a color image into a grayscale im-age or removing camera motion from an image sequence.\\nB e c a u s e  w e  ar e  s u c h  vi s u al  c r e a tur e s ,  i t  i s  e a s y  t o  b e  f o o l e d  in t o  th inkin g  th a t  c o m -\\nputer vision tasks are easy. How hard can it be to fi  nd, say, a car when you are staring \\nat it in an image? Your initial intuitions can be quite misleading. Th  e human brain di-\\nvides the vision signal into many channels that stream diff  erent kinds of information \\ninto your brain. Your brain has an attention system that identifi  es, in a task-dependent \\n* Computer vision is a vast fi  eld. Th  is book will give you a basic grounding in the fi  eld, but we also recom-\\nmend texts by Trucco [Trucco98] for a simple introduction, Forsyth [Forsyth03] as a comprehensive refer-\\nence, and Hartley [Hartley06] and Faugeras [Faugeras93] for how 3D vision really works.\\n01-R4886-RC1.indd   201-R4886-RC1.indd   2 9/15/08   4:17:45 PM9/15/08   4:17:45 PMWhat Is Computer Vision? | 3way, important parts of an image to examine while suppressing examination of other \\nareas. Th  ere is massive feedback in the visual stream that is, as yet, little understood. \\nTh ere are widespread associative inputs from muscle control sensors and all of the other \\nsenses that allow the brain to draw on cross-associations made from years of living in the world. Th  e feedback loops in the brain go back to all stages of processing including \\nthe hardware sensors themselves (the eyes), which mechanically control lighting via the iris and tune the reception on the surface of the retina.\\nIn a machine vision system, however, a computer receives a grid of numbers from the \\ncamera or from disk, and that’s it. For the most part, there’s no built-in pattern recog-nition, no automatic control of focus and aperture, no cross-associations with years of experience. For the most part, vision systems are still fairly naïve. Figure 1-1 shows a picture of an automobile. In that picture we see a side mirror on the driver’s side of the car. What the computer  “sees” is just a grid of numbers. Any given number within that \\ngrid has a rather large noise component and so by itself gives us little information, but this grid of numbers is all the computer “sees”. Our task then becomes to turn this noisy grid of numbers into the perception: “side mirror”. Figure 1-2 gives some more insight into why computer vision is so hard.\\nFigure 1-1. To a computer, the car’s side mirror is just a grid of numbers\\nIn fact, the problem, as we have posed it thus far, is worse than hard; it is formally im-possible to solve. Given a two-dimensional (2D) view of a 3D world, there is no unique way to reconstruct the 3D signal. Formally, such an ill-posed problem has no unique or defi nitive solution. Th  e same 2D image could represent any of an infi  nite combination \\nof 3D scenes, even if the data were perfect. However, as already mentioned, the data is \\n01-R4886-RC1.indd   301-R4886-RC1.indd   3 9/15/08   4:17:46 PM9/15/08   4:17:46 PM4 | Chapter 1: Overviewcorrupted by noise and distortions. Such corruption stems from variations in the world \\n(weather, lighting, refl  ections, movements), imperfections in the lens and mechanical \\nsetup, fi  nite integration time on the sensor (motion blur), electrical noise in the sensor \\nor other electronics, and compression artifacts aft  er image capture. Given these daunt-\\ning challenges, how can we make any progress?\\nIn the design of a practical system, additional contextual knowledge can oft  en be used \\nto work around the limitations imposed on us by visual sensors. Consider the example \\nof a mobile robot that must fi  nd and pick up staplers in a building. Th  e robot might use \\nthe facts that a desk is an object found inside offi   ces and that staplers are mostly found \\non desks. Th  is gives an implicit size reference; staplers must be able to fi  t on desks. It \\nalso helps to eliminate falsely “recognizing” staplers in impossible places (e.g., on the ceiling or a window). Th  e robot can safely ignore a 200-foot advertising blimp shaped \\nlike a stapler because the blimp lacks the prerequisite wood-grained background of a desk. In contrast, with tasks such as image retrieval, all stapler images in a database Figure 1-2. Th  e ill-posed nature of vision: the 2D appearance of objects can change radically with \\nviewpoint\\n01-R4886-RC1.indd   401-R4886-RC1.indd   4 9/15/08   4:17:46 PM9/15/08   4:17:46 PMWhat Is Computer Vision? | 5may be of real staplers and so large sizes and other unusual confi  gurations may have \\nbeen implicitly precluded by the assumptions of those who took the photographs. \\nTh a t  i s ,  t h e  p h o t o g r a p h e r  p r o b a b l y  t o o k  p i c t u r e s  o n l y  o f  r e a l ,  n o r m a l - s i z e d  s t a p l e r s .  \\nPeople also tend to center objects when taking pictures and tend to put them in char-acteristic orientations. Th  us, there is oft  en quite a bit of unintentional implicit informa-\\ntion within photos taken by people.\\nContextual information can also be modeled explicitly with machine learning tech-\\nniques. Hidden variables such as size, orientation to gravity, and so on can then be correlated with their values in a labeled training set. Alternatively, one may attempt to measure hidden bias variables by using additional sensors. Th  e use of a laser range \\nfi nder to measure depth allows us to accurately measure the size of an object.\\nTh e next problem facing computer vision is noise. W e typically deal with noise by us-\\ning statistical methods. For example, it may be impossible to detect an edge in an image merely by comparing a point to its immediate neighbors. But if we look at the statistics over a local region, edge detection becomes much easier. A real edge should appear as a string of such immediate neighbor responses over a local region, each of whose orienta-tion is consistent with its neighbors. It is al so possible to compensate for noise by taking \\nstatistics over time. Still other techniques account for noise or distortions by building ex-plicit models learned directly from the available data. For example, because lens distor-tions are well understood, one need only learn the parameters for a simple polynomial model in order to describe—and thus correct almost completely—such distortions.\\nTh e actions or decisions that computer vision attempts to make based on camera data \\nare performed in the context of a specifi  c purpose or task. We may want to remove noise \\nor damage from an image so that our security system will issue an alert if someone tries \\nto climb a fence or because we need a monitoring system that counts how many people cross through an area in an amusement park. Vision soft  ware for robots that wander \\nthrough offi   ce buildings will employ diff  e r e n t  s tra t e gi es  th an  vi s i o n  s o ft  ware for sta-\\ntionary security cameras because the two systems have signifi  cantly diff  erent contexts \\nand objectives. As a general rule: the more constrained a computer vision context is, the more we can rely on those constraints to simplify the problem and the more reliable our fi nal solution will be.\\nOpenCV is aimed at providing the basic tools needed to solve computer vision prob-lems. In some cases, high-level functionalities in the library will be suffi   cient to solve \\nthe more complex problems in computer vision. Even when this is not the case, the basic components in the library are complete enough to enable creation of a complete solu-tion of your own to almost any computer vision problem. In the latter case, there are several tried-and-true methods of using the library; all of them start with solving the problem using as many available library components as possible. Typically, aft  er you’ve \\ndeveloped this fi  rst-draft   solution, you can see where the solution has weaknesses and \\nthen fi  x those weaknesses using your own code and cleverness (better known as “solve the problem you actually have, not the one you imagine”). You can then use your draft   \\n01-R4886-RC1.indd   501-R4886-RC1.indd   5 9/15/08   4:17:46 PM9/15/08   4:17:46 PM6 | Chapter 1: Overviewsolution as a benchmark to assess the improvements you have made. From that point, \\nwhatever weaknesses remain can be tackled by exploiting the context of the larger sys-tem in which your problem solution is embedded.\\nThe Origin of OpenCV\\nOpenCV grew out of an Intel Research initiative to advance CPU-intensive applications. Toward this end, Intel launched many projects including real-time ray tracing and 3D display walls. One of the authors working for Intel at that time was visiting universities and noticed that some top university groups, such as the MIT Media Lab, had well-developed and internally open computer vision infrastructures—code that was passed from student to student and that gave each new student a valuable head start in develop-ing his or her own vision application. Instead of reinventing the basic functions from scratch, a new student could begin by building on top of what came before.\\nTh us, OpenCV was conceived as a way to make computer vision infrastructure uni-\\nversally available. With the aid of Intel’s Performance Library Team,* OpenCV started \\nwith a core of implemented code and algorithmic specifi  cations being sent to members \\nof Intel’s Russian library team. Th  is is the “where” of OpenCV: it started in Intel’s re-\\nsearch lab with collaboration from the Soft  ware Performance Libraries group together \\nwith implementation and optimization expertise in Russia.\\nChief among the Russian team members was Vadim Pisarevsky, who managed, coded, \\nand optimized much of OpenCV and who is still at the center of much of the OpenCV eff ort. Along with him, Victor Eruhimov helped develop the early infrastructure, and \\nValery Kuriakin managed the Russian lab and greatly supported the eff  ort. Th  ere were \\nseveral goals for OpenCV at the outset:\\nAdvance vision research by providing not only open but also optimized code for • \\nbasic vision infrastructure. No more reinventing the wheel.\\nDisseminate vision knowledge by providing a common infrastructure that develop-• \\ners could build on, so that code would be more readily readable and transferable.Advance vision-based commercial applications by making portable, performance-• \\noptimized code available for free—with a license that did not require commercial \\napplications to be open or free themselves.\\nTh ose goals constitute the “why” of OpenCV. Enabling computer vision applications \\nwould increase the need for fast processors. Driving upgrades to faster processors would generate more income for Intel than selling some extra soft  ware. Perhaps that is why this \\nopen and free code arose from a hardware vendor rather than a soft  ware company. In \\nsome sense, there is more room to be innovative at soft  ware within a hardware company.\\nIn an y open so ur ce eff  ort, it’s important to reach a critical mass at which the project \\nbecomes self-sustaining. Th  ere have now been approximately two million downloads \\n* Shinn Lee was of key help.\\n01-R4886-RC1.indd   601-R4886-RC1.indd   6 9/15/08   4:17:47 PM9/15/08   4:17:47 PMThe Origin of OpenCV | 7of OpenCV, and this number is growing by an average of 26,000 downloads a month. \\nTh e user group now approaches 20,000 members. OpenCV receives many user contri-\\nbutions, and central development has largely moved outside of Intel.* OpenCV’s past timeline is shown in Figure 1-3. Along the way, OpenCV was aff  ected by the dot-com \\nboom and bust and also by numerous changes of management and direction. During these fl  uctuations, there were times when OpenCV had no one at Intel working on it at \\nall. However, with the advent of multicore processors and the many new applications of computer vision, OpenCV’s value began to rise. Today, OpenCV is an active area of development at several institutions, so expect to see many updates in multicamera calibration, depth perception, methods for mixing vision with laser range fi  nders, and \\nbetter pattern recognition as well as a lot of support for robotic vision needs. For more information on the future of OpenCV, see Chapter 14.\\nSpeeding Up OpenCV with IPP\\nBecause OpenCV was “housed” within the Intel Performance Primitives team and sev-eral primary developers remain on friendly terms with that team, OpenCV exploits the hand-tuned, highly optimized code in IPP to speed itself up. Th  e improvement in speed \\nfrom using IPP can be substantial. Figure 1-4 compares two other vision libraries, LTI [LTI] and VXL [VXL], against OpenCV and OpenCV using IPP. Note that performance was a key goal of OpenCV; the library needed the ability to run vision code in real time.\\nOpenCV is written in performance-optimized C and C++ code. It does not depend in \\nany way on IPP. If IPP is present, however, OpenCV will automatically take advantage \\nof IPP by loading IPP’s dynamic link libraries to further enhance its speed.\\n* As of this writing, Willow Garage [WG] ( www.willowgarage.com ), a robotics research institute and \\nincubator, is actively supporting general OpenCV maintenance and new development in the area of \\nrobotics applications.Figure 1-3.

It is therefore open and free, and the code itself may be used or embedded (in whole or in part) in other applications, whether commercial or research. It does not force your application code to be open or free. It does not require that you return improvements back to the library—but we hope that you will.\\nDownloading and Installing OpenCV\\nTh e main OpenCV site is on SourceForge at http://SourceForge.net/projects/opencvlibrary \\nand the OpenCV Wiki [OpenCV Wiki] page is at http://opencvlibrary.SourceForge.net . \\nFor Linux, the source distribution is the fi  le opencv-1.0.0.tar.gz ; for Windows, you want \\nOpenCV_1.0.exe .

It was originally written to compile across Bor-\\nland C++, MSVC++, and the Intel compilers. Th  is meant that the C and C++ code had \\nto be fairly standard in order to make cross-platform support easier. Figure 1-6 shows the platforms on which OpenCV is known to run. Support for 32-bit Intel architecture (IA32) on Windows is the most mature, followed by Linux on the same architecture. Mac OS X portability became a priority only aft  er Apple started using Intel processors. \\n(Th e OS X port isn’t as mature as the Windows or Linux versions, but this is changing \\nrapidly.) Th  ese are followed by 64-bit support on extended memory (EM64T) and the \\n64-bit Intel architecture (IA64). Th  e least mature portability is on Sun hardware and \\nother operating systems.\\nIf an ar chi tecture o r OS doesn ’ t appear in F igure 1 -6, this doesn ’ t mean there are no \\nOpenCV ports to it. OpenCV has been ported to almost every commercial system, from PowerPC Macs to robotic dogs. OpenCV runs well on AMD’s line of processors, and even the further optimizations available in IPP will take advantage of multimedia ex-tensions (MMX) in AMD processors that incorporate this technology.\\n01-R4886-RC1.indd   1401-R4886-RC1.indd   14 9/15/08   4:17:48 PM9/15/08   4:17:48 PMExercises | 15Exercises\\nDownload and install the latest release of OpenCV.

In order to do this, we will need to set up the program-\\nming environment.\\nIn Visual Studio, it is necessary to create a project and to confi  gure the setup so that \\n(a) the libraries highgui.lib , cxcore.lib , ml.lib , and cv.lib  are linked* and (b) the prepro-\\nc e s s o r  will  s e ar c h  th e  O p e n C V  …/opencv/*/include  directories for header fi  les. Th  ese \\n“include” directories will typically be named something like C:/program fi  les/opencv/\\ncv/include ,† …/opencv/cxcore/include , …/opencv/ml/include , and …/opencv/otherlibs/\\nhighgui . Once you’ve done this, you can create a new C fi  le and start your fi  rst program.\\nCertain key header fi  les can make your life much easier. Many useful \\nmacros are in the header fi  les …/opencv/cxcore/include/cxtypes.h  and \\ncxmisc.h . Th ese can do things like initialize structures and arrays in one \\nline, sort lists, and so on. Th  e most important headers for compiling are \\n.../cv/include/cv.h  and …/cxcore/include/cxcore.h  for computer vision, \\n…/otherlibs/highgui/highgui.h  for I/O, and …/ml/include/ml.h  for ma-\\nchine learning.\\nFirst Program—Display a Picture\\nOpenCV provides utilities for reading from a wide array of image fi  le types as well as \\nfrom video and cameras. Th  ese utilities are part of a toolkit called HighGUI, which is \\nincluded in the OpenCV package. We will use some of these utilities to create a simple \\nprogram that opens an image and displays it on the screen. See Example 2-1.\\n* For debug builds, you should link to the libraries highguid.lib , cxcored.lib , mld.lib , and cvd.lib .\\n† C:/program fi  les/ is the default installation of the OpenCV directory on Windows, although you can choose \\nto install it elsewhere. To avoid confusion, from here on we’ll use “ …/opencv/ ” to mean the path to the \\nopencv directory on your system.\\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   1602-R4886-AT1.indd   16 9/15/08   4:18:10 PM9/15/08   4:18:10 PMFirst Program—Display a Picture | 17Example 2-1. A simple OpenCV program that loads an image from disk and displays it on the screen\\n#include “highgui.h”\\nint main( int argc, char** argv ) {\\n    IplImage* img = cvLoadImage( argv[1] );    cvNamedWindow( “Example1”, CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE );    cvShowImage( “Example1”, img );    cvWaitKey(0);    cvReleaseImage( &img );    cvDestroyWindow( “Example1” );\\n}\\nWhen compiled and run from the command line with a single argument, this program \\nloads an image into memory and displays it on the screen. It then waits until the user presses a key, at which time it closes the window and exits. Let’s go through the program line by line and take a moment to understand what each command is doing.\\nIplImage* img = cvLoadImage( argv[1] );\\nTh is line loads the image.* Th  e function cvLoadImage()  is a high-level routine that deter-\\nmines the fi  le format to be loaded based on the fi  le name; it also automatically allocates \\nthe memory needed for the image data structure. Note that cvLoadImage()  can read a \\nwide variety of image formats, including BMP, DIB, JPEG, JPE, PNG, PBM, PGM, PPM, SR, RAS, and TIFF. A pointer to an allocated image data structure is then returned. Th is structure, called \\nIplImage , is the OpenCV construct with which you will deal \\nthe most. OpenCV uses this structure to handle all kinds of images: single-channel, multichannel, integer-valued, fl  oating-point-valued, et cetera. We use the pointer that \\ncvLoadImage() returns to manipulate the image and the image data.\\ncvNamedWindow( “Example1”, CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE );\\nAnother high-level function, cvNamedWindow() , opens a window on the screen that can \\ncontain and display an image. Th  is function, provided by the HighGUI library, also as-\\nsigns a name to the window (in this case, “Example1” ). Future HighGUI calls that inter-\\nact with this window will refer to it by this name.\\nTh e second argument to cvNamedWindow()  defi nes window properties. It may be set ei-\\nther to 0 (the default value) or to CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE . In the former case, the size of the \\nwindow will be the same regardless of the image size, and the image will be scaled to \\nfi t within the window. In the latter case, the window will expand or contract automati-\\ncally when an image is loaded so as to accommodate the image’s true size.\\ncvShowImage( “Example1”, img );\\nWhenever we have an image in the form of an IplImage*  pointer, we can display it in an \\nexisting window with cvShowImage() . Th e cvShowImage()  function requires that a named \\nwindow already exist (created by cvNamedWindow() ) .  O n  th e  c all  t o  cvShowImage() , the \\n* A proper program would check for the existence of argv[1] and, in its absence, deliver an instructional \\nerror message for the user. We will abbreviate such necessities in this book and assume that the reader is \\ncultured enough to understand the importance of error-handling code.\\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   1702-R4886-AT1.indd   17 9/15/08   4:18:11 PM9/15/08   4:18:11 PM18 | Chapter 2: Introduction to OpenCVwindow will be redrawn with the appropriate image in it, and the window will resize \\nitself as appropriate if it was created using the CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE  fl ag.\\ncvWaitKey(0);\\nTh e cvWaitKey()  function asks the program to stop and wait for a keystroke. If a positive \\nargument is given, the program will wait for that number of milliseconds and then con-tinue even if nothing is pressed. If the argument is set to 0 or to a negative number, the program will wait indefi  nitely for a keypress.\\ncvReleaseImage( &img );\\nOnce we are through with an image, we can free the allocated memory. OpenCV ex-pects a pointer to the \\nIplImage*  pointer for this operation. Aft  er the call is completed, \\nthe pointer img will be set to NULL.\\ncvDestroyWindow( “Example1” );\\nFinally, we can destroy the window itself. Th  e function cvDestroyWindow()  will close the \\nwindow and de-allocate any associated memory usage (including the window’s internal image buff  er, which is holding a copy of the pixel information from \\n*img ). For a simple \\nprogram, you don’t really have to call cvDestroyWindow()  or cvReleaseImage()  because all \\nthe resources and windows of the application are closed automatically by the operating system upon exit, but it’s a good habit anyway.\\nNow that we have this simple program we can toy around with it in various ways, but we \\ndon’t want to get ahead of ourselves. Our next task will be to construct a very simple—almost as simple as this one—program to read in and display an AVI video fi  le. Aft  er \\nthat, we will start to tinker a little more.\\nSecond Program—AVI Video\\nPlay ing a video with OpenCV is a lmost as easy as display ing a single picture. Th  e only new \\nissue we face is that we need some kind of loop to read each frame in sequence; we may also need some way to get out of that loop if the movie is too boring. See Example 2-2.\\nExample 2-2. A simple OpenCV program for playing a video fi  le from disk\\n#include “highgui.h”\\nint main( int argc, char** argv ) {\\n    cvNamedWindow( “Example2”, CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE );    CvCapture* capture = cvCreateFileCapture( argv[1] );    IplImage* frame;    while(1) {        frame = cvQueryFrame( capture );        if( !frame ) break;        cvShowImage( “Example2”, frame );        char c = cvWaitKey(33);        if( c == 27 ) break;    }    cvReleaseCapture( &capture );    cvDestroyWindow( “Example2” );}\\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   1802-R4886-AT1.indd   18 9/15/08   4:18:11 PM9/15/08   4:18:11 PMMoving Around | 19Here we begin the function main()  with the usual creation of a named window, in this \\ncase “Example2 ”. Th ings get a little more interesting aft  er that.\\nCvCapture* capture = cvCreateFileCapture( argv[1] );\\nTh e function cvCreateFileCapture()  takes as its argument the name of the AVI fi  le to be \\nloaded and then returns a pointer to a CvCapture  structure. Th  is structure contains all of \\nthe information about the AVI fi  le being read, including state information. When cre-\\nated in this way, the CvCapture  structure is initialized to the beginning of the AVI.\\nframe = cvQueryFrame( capture );\\nOn ce insi de o f the while(1)  loop, we begin reading from the AVI fi  le. cvQueryFrame()  \\ntakes as its argument a pointer to a CvCapture  structure. It then grabs the next video \\nframe into memory (memory that is actually part of the CvCapture  structure). A pointer \\nis returned to that frame. Unlike cvLoadImage , which actually allocates memory for the \\nimage, cvQueryFrame  uses memory already allocated in the CvCapture  structure. Th  us it \\nwill not be necessary (or wise) to call cvReleaseImage()  for this “frame” pointer. Instead, \\nthe frame image memory will be freed when the CvCapture  structure is released.\\nc = cvWaitKey(33);\\nif( c == 27 ) break;\\nOnce we have displayed the frame, we then wait for 33 ms.* If the user hits a key, then c \\nwill be set to the ASCII value of that key; if not, then it will be set to –1. If the user hits \\nthe Esc key (ASCII 27), then we will exit the read loop. Otherwise, 33 ms will pass and we will just execute the loop again.\\nIt is worth noting that, in this simple example, we are not explicitly controlling \\nthe speed of the video in any intelligent way. We are relying solely on the timer in \\ncvWaitKey()  to pace the loading of frames. In a more sophisticated application it would \\nbe wise to read the actual frame rate from the CvCapture  structure (from the AVI) and \\nbehave accordingly!\\ncvReleaseCapture( &capture );\\nWhen we have exited the read loop—because there was no more video data or because the user hit the Esc key—we can free the memory associated with the \\nCvCapture  struc-\\nture. Th  is will also close any open fi  le handles to the AVI fi  le.\\nMoving Around\\nOK, that was great. Now it’s time to tinker around, enhance our toy programs, and ex-plore a little more of the available functionality. Th  e fi rst thing we might notice about \\nthe AVI player of Example 2-2 is that it has no way to move around quickly within the video. Our next task will be to add a slider bar, which will give us this ability.\\n* You can wait any amount of time you like. In this case, we are simply assuming that it is correct to play \\nthe video at 30 frames per second and allow user input to interrupt between each frame (thus we pause \\nfor input 33 ms between each frame). In practice, it is better to check the CvCapture  structure returned by \\ncvCaptureFromCamera()  in order to determine the actual frame rate (more on this in Chapter 4).\\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   1902-R4886-AT1.indd   19 9/15/08   4:18:11 PM9/15/08   4:18:11 PM20 | Chapter 2: Introduction to OpenCVTh e HighGUI toolkit provides a number of simple instruments for working with im-\\nages and video beyond the simple display functions we have just demonstrated. One \\nespecially useful mechanism is the slider, which enables us to jump easily from one part of a video to another. To create a slider, we call \\ncvCreateTrackbar()  and indicate which \\nwindow we would like the trackbar to appear in. In order to obtain the desired func-tionality, we need only supply a callback that will perform the relocation. Example 2-3 gives the details.\\nExample 2-3. Program to add a trackbar slider to the basic viewer window: when the slider is \\nmoved, the function onTrackbarSlide() is called and then passed to the slider’s new value\\n#include “cv.h”\\n#include “highgui.h”\\nint        g_slider_position = 0;\\nCvCapture* g_capture         = NULL;\\nvoid onTrackbarSlide(int pos) {\\n    cvSetCaptureProperty(        g_capture,        CV_CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES,        pos    );}\\nint main( int argc, char** argv ) {\\n    cvNamedWindow( “Example3”, CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE );    g_capture = cvCreateFileCapture( argv[1] );    int frames = (int) cvGetCaptureProperty(        g_capture,        CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT    );    if( frames!= 0 ) {      cvCreateTrackbar(          “Position”,          “Example3”,          &g_slider_position,          frames,          onTrackbarSlide      );    }    IplImage* frame;    // While loop (as in Example 2) capture & show video    …    // Release memory and destroy window    …    return(0);}\\nIn essence, then, the strategy is to add a global variable to represent the slider position \\nand then add a callback that updates this variable and relocates the read position in the \\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   2002-R4886-AT1.indd   20 9/15/08   4:18:11 PM9/15/08   4:18:11 PMMoving Around | 21video. One call creates the slider and attaches the callback, and we are off   and running.* \\nLet’s look at the details.\\nint g_slider_position = 0;\\nCvCapture* g_capture  = NULL;\\nFirst we defi  ne a global variable for the slider position. Th  e callback will need access to \\nthe capture object, so we promote that to a global variable. Because we are nice people \\nand like our code to be readable and easy to understand, we adopt the convention of adding a leading \\ng_ to any global variable.\\nvoid onTrackbarSlide(int pos) {\\n    cvSetCaptureProperty(    g_capture,    CV_CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES,    pos );\\nNow we defi  ne a callback routine to be used when the user pokes the slider. Th  is routine \\nwill be passed to a 32-bit integer, which will be the slider position.\\nTh e call to cvSetCaptureProperty()  is one we will see oft  en in the future, along with its \\ncounterpart cvGetCaptureProperty() . Th ese routines allow us to confi  gure (or query in \\nthe latter case) various properties of the CvCapture  object. In this case we pass the argu-\\nment CV_CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES , which indicates that we would like to set the read position \\nin units of frames. (We can use AVI_RATIO  instead of FRAMES  if we want to set the position \\nas a fraction of the overall video length). Finally, we pass in the new value of the posi-\\ntion. Because HighGUI is highly civilized, it will automatically handle such issues as the possibility that the frame we have requested is not a key-frame; it will start at the previous key-frame and fast forward up to the requested frame without us having to fuss with such details.\\nint frames = (int) cvGetCaptureProperty(\\n    g_capture,    CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT);\\nAs promised, we use cvGetCaptureProperty() when we want to query some data from the \\nCvCapture  structure. In this case, we want to fi  nd out how many frames are in the video \\nso that we can calibrate the slider (in the next step).\\nif( frames!= 0 ) {  cvCreateTrackbar(      “Position”,      “Example3”,      &g_slider_position,      frames,      onTrackbarSlide  );}\\n* Th is code does not update the slider position as the video plays; we leave that as an exercise for the reader. \\nAlso note that some mpeg encodings do not allow you to move backward in the video.\\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   2102-R4886-AT1.indd   21 9/15/08   4:18:11 PM9/15/08   4:18:11 PM22 | Chapter 2: Introduction to OpenCVTh e last detail is to create the trackbar itself. Th  e function cvCreateTrackbar()  allows us \\nto give the trackbar a label* (in this case Position ) and to specify a window to put the \\ntrackbar in. We then provide a variable that will be bound to the trackbar, the maxi-\\nmum value of the trackbar, and a callback (or NULL if we don’t want one) for when the slider is moved. Observe that we do not create the trackbar if \\ncvGetCaptureProperty()  \\nreturned a zero frame count. Th  is is because sometimes, depending on how the video \\nwas encoded, the total number of frames will not be available. In this case we will just play the movie without providing a trackbar.\\nIt is worth noting that the slider created by HighGUI is not as full-featured as some slid-\\ners out there. Of course, there’s no reason you can’t use your favorite windowing toolkit instead of HighGUI, but the HighGUI tools are quick to implement and get us off   the \\nground in a hurry.\\nFinally, we did not include the extra tidbit of code needed to make the slider move as the \\nvideo plays. Th  is is left   as an exercise for the reader.\\nA Simple Transformation\\nGreat, so now you can use OpenCV to create your own video player, which will not be much diff  erent from countless video players out there already. But we are interested in \\ncomputer vision, and we want to do some of that. Many basic vision tasks involve the application of fi  lters to a video stream. We will modify the program we already have to \\ndo a simple operation on every frame of the video as it plays.\\nOne particularly simple operation is the smoothing of an image, which eff  ectively re-\\nduces the information content of the image by convolving it with a Gaussian or other \\nsimilar kernel function. OpenCV makes such convolutions exceptionally easy to do. We can start by creating a new window called \\n“Example4-out” , where we can display the \\nresults of the processing. Th  en, aft  er we have called cvShowImage()  to display the newly \\ncaptured frame in the input window, we can compute and display the smoothed image in the output window. See Example 2-4.\\nExample 2-4. Loading and then smoothing an image before it is displayed on the screen\\n#include “cv.h”\\n#include “highgui.h”    void example2_4( IplImage* image )\\n    // Create some windows to show the input\\n    // and output images in.    //    cvNamedWindow( “Example4-in” );\\n* Because HighGUI is a lightweight and easy-to-use toolkit, cvCreateTrackbar()  does not distinguish \\nbetween the name of the trackbar and the label that actually appears on the screen next to the trackbar. You \\nmay already have noticed that cvNamedWindow()  likewise does not distinguish between the name of the \\nwindow and the label that appears on the window in the GUI.\\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   2202-R4886-AT1.indd   22 9/15/08   4:18:11 PM9/15/08   4:18:11 PMA Simple Transformation | 23Example 2-4. Loading and then smoothing an image before it is displayed on the screen (continued)\\n    cvNamedWindow( “Example4-out” );\\n        // Create a window to show our input image    //    cvShowImage( “Example4-in”, image );        // Create an image to hold the smoothed output    //    IplImage* out = cvCreateImage(        cvGetSize(image),        IPL_DEPTH_8U,        3    );        // Do the smoothing    //    cvSmooth( image, out, CV_GAUSSIAN, 3, 3 );        // Show the smoothed image in the output window    //    cvShowImage( “Example4-out”, out );        // Be tidy    //    cvReleaseImage( &out );\\n    // Wait for the user to hit a key, then clean up the windows\\n    //    cvWaitKey( 0 );     cvDestroyWindow( “Example4-in” );    cvDestroyWindow( “Example4-out” );    }\\nTh e fi rst call to cvShowImage()  is no diff  erent than in our previous example. In the next \\ncall, we allocate another image structure. Previously we relied on cvCreateFileCapture()  \\nto allocate the new frame for us. In fact, that routine actually allocated only one frame \\nand then wrote over that data each time a capture call was made (so it actually returned the same pointer every time we called it). In this case, however, we want to allocate our own image structure to which we can write our smoothed image. Th  e fi rst argument is \\na \\nCvSize  structure, which we can conveniently create by calling cvGetSize(image);  this \\ngives us the size of the existing structure image . Th e second argument tells us what kind \\nof data type is used for each channel on each pixel, and the last argument indicates the number of channels. So this image is three channels (with 8 bits per channel) and is the same size as \\nimage .\\nTh e smoothing operation is itself just a single call to the OpenCV library: we specify \\nthe input image, the output image, the smoothing method, and the parameters for the smooth. In this case we are requesting a Gaussian smooth over a 3 × 3 area centered on each pixel. It is actually allowed for the output to be the same as the input image, and \\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   2302-R4886-AT1.indd   23 9/15/08   4:18:12 PM9/15/08   4:18:12 PM24 | Chapter 2: Introduction to OpenCVthis would work more effi   ciently in our current application, but we avoided doing this \\nbecause it gave us a chance to introduce cvCreateImage() !\\nNow we can show the image in our new second window and then free it: cvReleaseImage()  \\ntakes a pointer to the IplImage*  pointer and then de-allocates all of the memory associ-\\nated with that image.\\nA Not-So-Simple Transformation\\nTh at was pretty good, and we are learning to do more interesting things. In Example 2-4 \\nwe chose to allocate a new IplImage  structure, and into this new structure we wrote the \\noutput of a single transformation. As mentioned, we could have applied the transforma-\\ntion in such a way that the output overwrites the original, but this is not always a good idea. In particular, some operators do not produce images with the same size, depth, and number of channels as the input image. Typically, we want to perform a sequence  of \\noperations on some initial image and so produce a chain of transformed images.\\nIn such cases, it is oft  en useful to introduce simple wrapper functions that both allocate \\nthe output image and perform the transformation we are interested in. Consider, for \\nexample, the reduction of an image by a factor of 2 [Rosenfeld80]. In OpenCV this is ac-complished by the function \\ncvPyrDown() , which performs a Gaussian smooth and then \\nremoves every other line from an image. Th  is is useful in a wide variety of important \\nvision algorithms. We can implement the simple function described in Example 2-5.\\nExample 2-5. Using cvPyrDown() to create a new image that is half the width and height of the input \\nimage\\nIplImage* doPyrDown(\\n  IplImage* in,  int       filter = IPL_GAUSSIAN_5x5) {\\n    // Best to make sure input image is divisible by two.\\n    //    assert( in->width%2 == 0 && in->height%2 == 0 );\\n    IplImage* out = cvCreateImage( \\n        cvSize( in->width/2, in->height/2 ),        in->depth,        in->nChannels    );    cvPyrDown( in, out );    return( out );};\\nNotice that we allocate the new image by reading the needed parameters from the old \\nimage. In OpenCV, all of the important data types are implemented as structures and passed around as structure pointers. Th  ere is no such thing as private data in OpenCV!\\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   2402-R4886-AT1.indd   24 9/15/08   4:18:12 PM9/15/08   4:18:12 PMA Not-So-Simple Transformation | 25Let’s now look at a similar but slightly more involved example involving the Canny edge \\ndetector [Canny86] (see Example 2-6). In this case, the edge detector generates an image \\nthat is the full size of the input image but needs only a single channel image to write to.\\nExample 2-6. Th  e Canny edge detector writes its output to a single channel (grayscale) image\\nIplImage* doCanny(\\n    IplImage* in,    double    lowThresh,    double    highThresh,    double    aperture) {    If(in->nChannels != 1)        return(0); //Canny only handles gray scale images\\n    IplImage* out = cvCreateImage(\\n        cvSize( cvGetSize( in ),        IPL_DEPTH_8U,           1    );    cvCanny( in, out, lowThresh, highThresh, aperture );    return( out );};\\nTh is allows us to string together various operators quite easily. For example, if we wanted \\nto shrink the image twice and then look for lines that were present in the twice-reduced \\nimage, we could proceed as in Example 2-7.\\nExample 2-7. Combining the pyramid down operator (twice) and the Canny subroutine in a simple \\nimage pipeline\\nIplImage* img1 = doPyrDown( in, IPL_GAUSSIAN_5x5 );\\nIplImage* img2 = doPyrDown( img1, IPL_GAUSSIAN_5x5 );IplImage* img3 = doCanny( img2, 10, 100, 3 );\\n// do whatever with ‘img3’\\n//…cvReleaseImage( &img1 );cvReleaseImage( &img2 );cvReleaseImage( &img3 );\\nIt is important to observe that nesting the calls to various stages of our fi  ltering pipeline \\nis not a good idea, because then we would have no way to free the images that we are \\nallocating along the way. If we are too lazy to do this cleanup, we could opt to include the following line in each of the wrappers:\\ncvReleaseImage( &in );\\nTh is “self-cleaning” mechanism would be very tidy, but it would have the following dis-\\nadvantage: if we actually did want to do something with one of the intermediate images, we would have no access to it. In order to solve that problem, the preceding code could be simplifi  ed as described in Example 2-8.\\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   2502-R4886-AT1.indd   25 9/15/08   4:18:12 PM9/15/08   4:18:12 PM26 | Chapter 2: Introduction to OpenCVExample 2-8. Simplifying the image pipeline of Example 2-7 by making the individual stages release \\ntheir intermediate memory allocations\\nIplImage* out;\\nout = doPyrDown( in, IPL_GAUSSIAN_5x5 );out = doPyrDown( out, IPL_GAUSSIAN_5x5 );out = doCanny( out, 10, 100, 3 );\\n// do whatever with ‘out’\\n//…cvReleaseImage ( &out );\\nOne fi  nal word of warning on the self-cleaning fi  lter pipeline: in OpenCV we must al-\\nways be certain that an image (or other structure) being de-allocated is one that was, \\nin fact, explicitly allocated previously. Consider the case of the IplImage*  pointer re-\\nturned by cvCreateFileCapture() . Here the pointer points to a structure allocated as \\npart of the CvCapture  structure, and the target structure is allocated only once when the \\nCvCapture  is initialized and an AVI is loaded. De-allocating this structure with a call to \\ncvRelease Image()  would result in some nasty surprises. Th  e moral of this story is that, \\nalthough it’ s important to take care of garbage collection in OpenCV , we should only clean up the garbage that we have created.\\nInput from a Camera\\nVision can mean many things in the world of computers. In some cases we are analyz-ing still frames loaded from elsewhere. In other cases we are analyzing video that is be-ing read from disk. In still other cases, we want to work with real-time data streaming in from some kind of camera device.\\nOpenCV—more specifi  cally, the HighGUI portion of the OpenCV library—provides us \\nwi th  an  e a s y  w a y  t o  h an dl e  th i s  s i t u a ti o n .  Th  e method is analogous to how we read \\nAVIs. Instead of calling \\ncvCreateFileCapture() , we call cvCreateCameraCapture() . Th e \\nlatter routine does not take a fi  le name but rather a camera ID number as its argument. \\nOf course, this is important only when multiple cameras are available. Th  e default value \\nis –1, which means “just pick one”; naturally, this works quite well when there is only \\none camera to pick (see Chapter 4 for more details).\\nTh e cvCreateCameraCapture()  function returns the same CvCapture*  pointer, which we \\ncan hereaft  er use exactly as we did with the frames grabbed from a video stream. Of \\ncourse, a lot of work is going on behind the scenes to make a sequence of camera images \\nlook like a video, but we are insulated from all of that. We can simply grab images from the camera whenever we are ready for them and proceed as if we did not know the dif-ference. For development reasons, most applications that are intended to operate in real time will have a video-in mode as well, and the universality of the \\nCvCapture  structure \\nmakes this particularly easy to implement. See Example 2-9.\\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   2602-R4886-AT1.indd   26 9/15/08   4:18:12 PM9/15/08   4:18:12 PMWriting to an AVI File | 27Example 2-9. Aft  er the capture structure is initialized, it no longer matters whether the image is \\nfrom a camera or a fi  le\\nCvCapture* capture;\\nif( argc==1 ) {\\n    capture = cvCreateCameraCapture(0);} else {    capture = cvCreateFileCapture( argv[1] );}assert( capture != NULL );\\n// Rest of program proceeds totally ignorant\\n…\\nAs you can see, this arrangement is quite ideal.\\nWriting to an AVI File\\nIn many applications we will want to record streaming input or even disparate captured \\nimages to an output video stream, and OpenCV provides a straightforward method for doing this. Just as we are able to create a capture device that allows us to grab frames one at a time from a video stream, we are able to create a writer device that allows us to place frames one by one into a video fi  le. Th  e  r o u tin e  th a t  all o w s  u s  t o  d o  thi s  i s  \\ncvCreateVideoWriter() .\\nOnce this call has been made, we may successively call cvWriteFrame() , once for each \\nframe, and fi  nally cvReleaseVideoWriter()  when we are done. Example 2-10 describes \\na simple program that opens a video fi  le, reads the contents, converts them to a log-\\npolar format (something like what your eye actually sees, as described in Chapter 6), and writes out the log-polar image to a new video fi  le.\\nExample 2-10. A complete program to read in a color video and write out the same video in grayscale\\n// Convert a video to grayscale\\n // argv[1]: input video file // argv[2]: name of new output file //#include “cv.h”#include “highgui.h”main( int argc, char* argv[] ) {    CvCapture* capture = 0;    capture = cvCreateFileCapture( argv[1] );    if(!capture){        return -1;    }    IplImage *bgr_frame=cvQueryFrame(capture);//Init the video read    double fps = cvGetCaptureProperty (        capture,        CV_CAP_PROP_FPS    );\\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   2702-R4886-AT1.indd   27 9/15/08   4:18:12 PM9/15/08   4:18:12 PM28 | Chapter 2: Introduction to OpenCVExample 2-10. A complete program to read in a color video and write out the same video in \\ngrayscale (continued)\\n    CvSize size = cvSize(\\n       (int)cvGetCaptureProperty( capture, CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH),       (int)cvGetCaptureProperty( capture, CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT)    );    CvVideoWriter *writer = cvCreateVideoWriter(        argv[2],        CV_FOURCC(‘M’,‘J’,‘P’,‘G’),        fps,        size    );    IplImage* logpolar_frame = cvCreateImage(        size,        IPL_DEPTH_8U,        3    );    while( (bgr_frame=cvQueryFrame(capture)) != NULL ) {        cvLogPolar( bgr_frame, logpolar_frame,                    cvPoint2D32f(bgr_frame->width/2,                    bgr_frame->height/2),                    40,                    CV_INTER_LINEAR+CV_WARP_FILL_OUTLIERS );        cvWriteFrame( writer, logpolar_frame );    }    cvReleaseVideoWriter( &writer );    cvReleaseImage( &logpolar_frame );    cvReleaseCapture( &capture );    return(0);}\\nLooking over this program reveals mostly familiar elements. We open one video; start \\nreading with cvQueryFrame() , which is necessary to read the video properties on some \\nsystems; and then use cvGetCaptureProperty()  to ascertain various important proper-\\nties of the video stream. We then open a video fi  le for writing, convert the frame to log-\\npolar format, and write the frames to this new fi  le one at a time until there are none left  . \\nTh en we close up.\\nTh e call to cvCreateVideoWriter()  c o n tain s  s ev e ral  p aram e t e r s  th a t  w e  s h o ul d  un d e r -\\nstand. Th  e fi rst is just the fi  lename for the new fi  le. Th  e second is the video codec  with \\nwhich the video stream will be compressed. Th  ere are countless such codecs in cir-\\nculation, but whichever codec you choose must be available on your machine (codecs are installed separately from OpenCV). In our case we choose the relatively popular MJPG  codec; this is indicated to OpenCV by using the macro \\nCV_FOURCC() , which takes \\nfour characters as arguments. Th  ese characters constitute the “four-character code” of \\nthe codec, and every codec has such a code. Th  e four-character code for motion jpeg  is \\nMJPG, so we specify that as CV_FOURCC(‘M’,‘J’,‘P’,‘G’) .\\nTh e next two arguments are the replay frame rate, and the size of the images we will be \\nusing. In our case, we set these to the values we got from the original (color) video.\\n02-R4886-AT1.indd   2802-R4886-AT1.indd   28 9/15/08   4:18:12 PM9/15/08   4:18:12 PMExercises | 29Onward\\nBefore moving on to the next chapter, we should take a moment to take stock of where \\nwe are and look ahead to what is coming. We have seen that the OpenCV API provides us with a variety of easy-to-use tools for loading still images from fi  les, reading video \\nfrom disk, or capturing video from cameras. We have also seen that the library con-tains primitive functions for manipulating these images. What we have not yet seen are the powerful elements of the library, which allow for more sophisticated manipulation of the entire set of abstract data types that are important to practical vision problem solving.\\nIn the next few chapters we will delve more deeply into the basics and come to under-\\nstand in greater detail both the interface-related functions and the image data types. We will investigate the primitive image manipulation operators and, later, some much more advanced ones. Th  ereaft  er, we will be ready to explore the many specialized services \\nthat the API provides for tasks as diverse as camera calibration, tracking, and recogni-tion. Ready? Let’s go!\\nExercises\\nDownload and install OpenCV if you have not already done so. Systematically go through the directory structure. Note in particular the docs  directory; there you can \\nload index.htm , which further links to the main documentation of the library. Further \\nexplore the main areas of the library.

For one, it gave me my second book. And two, it is not  \\nevery day you sit in an empty compartment and a young, pretty girl walks in.\\nYes, you see it in the movies, you hear about it from friend’s friend but  \\nit never happens to you. When I was younger, I used to look at the reservation  \\nchart stuck outside my train bogie to check out all the female passengers near  \\nmy seat (F-17 to F-25)is what I’d look for most). Yet, it never happened. In  \\nmost cases I shard my compartment with talkative aunties, snoring men and  \\nwailing infants.\\nBut this night was different. First, my compartment was empty. The  \\nRailways bad just started this new summer train and nobody knew about it.  \\nSecond, I was unable to sleep.\\nI had been to IIT Kanpur for a talk. Before leaving, I drank four cups of  \\ncoffee in the canteen while chatting with students. Bad idea, given that it was  \\ngoing to be boring to spend eight insomniac hours in an empty compartment. I  \\nhad no magazines or books to read. I could hardly see anything out of the  \\nwindow in the darkness. I prepared myself for a silent and dull night. It was  \\nanything but that. \\nShe walked in five minutes after the train bad left the station. She  \\nopened the curtain of my enclosure and looked puzzled. \\n‘Is coach A4, seat 63 here?’ she said.\\nThe yellow light bulb in my compartment was a moody one. It flickered  \\nas I looked up at her.\\n‘Hub…’ I said when I saw her face. It was difficult to withdraw from the  \\ngaze of her eyes.\\n‘Actually it is. My seat is right in front of you,’ she answered her own  \\nquestion and heaved her heavy suitcase onto the upper berth. She sat down  \\non the berth opposite me, and gave out a sigh of relief.\\n‘I climbed onto the wrong coach. Luckily the bogies are connected,’ she  \\nsaid, adjusting her long hair that ended n countless ringlets. From the corner  \\nof my eye I tried to look at her. She was young, perhaps early to mid-\\ntwenties. Her waist-length hair had a life of its own: a strand fell on her  \\nforehead repeatedly. I could no see her face clearly, but I could tell one thing\\n—she was pretty. And her eyes—once you looked into them, you could not  \\nturn away. I kept my gaze down.\\nShe re-arranged stuff in her handbag. I tried to look out of the window.  \\nIt was completely dark.\\n‘So, pretty empty train,’ she said after ten minutes.\\n‘Yes,’ I said. ‘It’s the new holiday special. They just started it, without  \\ntelling people about it.’\\n‘No wonder. Otherwise, trains are always full at this time.’‘It will get full. Don’t worry. Just give it a few days,’ I said ad leaned  \\nforward, ‘Hi. I am Chetan by the way, Chetan Bhagat.’\\n“Hi,’ she said and looked at me for a few seconds. ‘Chetan…I don’t  \\nknow, your name sounds familiar.’\\nNow this was cool. It meant she had  heard of my first book. I am  \\nrecognized rarely. And of course, it had never happened with a girl on a night  \\ntrain.\\n‘You  might  have  heard  of  my  book,  Five  Point  Someone.  I’m  the  \\nauthor,’ I said.\\n‘Oh yes,’ she said and paused. ‘Oh yes, of course. I’ve read your book.  \\nThe three underperformers and the prof’s daughter one, right?’ she said.\\n‘Yes. So how did you like it?’\\n‘It was all right.’\\nI was taken aback. Man, I could have done with a little more of a  \\ncompliment here.\\n‘Just all right?’ I said, fishing a bit too obviously.\\n‘Well…’ she said and paused.\\n‘Well what?’ I said after ten seconds.\\n‘Well. Yeah, just all right… okay okay types,’ she said.\\nI kept quiet. She noticed the expression of mild disappointment on my  \\nface.\\n‘Anyways, nice to meet you Chetan. Where are you coming from? IIT  \\nKanpur?’\\n‘Yes,’ I said, my voice less friendly than a few moments ago. ‘I had to  \\ngive a talk there.’\\n‘Oh really? About what?’\\n‘About my book—you know the just okay-okay type one. Some people do  \\nwant to hear about it,’ I said, keeping a sweet tone to sugarcoat my sarcasm-\\nfilled words.\\n‘Interesting,’ she said and turned quite again.\\nI was quite too. I didn’t want to speak to her anymore. I wanted my  \\nempty compartment back.\\nThe flickering yellow light above was irritating me. I wondered if I  \\nshould just shut it off, but it was not that Late yet.\\n‘What’s the next station? Is it a non-stop train?’ she asked after five  \\nminutes, obviously to make conversation.\\n‘I don’t know,’ I said and turned to look out of the window again even  \\nthough I couldn’t see anything in the darkness.\\n‘Is everything okay?’ she asked softly.\\n‘Yes, why?’ I sad, the tone of my ‘why’ giving away that everything was,  \\nin fact, not okay.\\n‘Nothing. You’ve upset about what I said about your book right?’\\n‘Not really,’ I said.\\nShe laughed. I looked at her. Just like her gaze, her smile was arresting  \\ntoo. I knew she was laughing at me, but I wanted her to keep smiling. I  \\ndragged my eyes away again.‘Listen. I know your book did well. You are like this youth writer and  \\neverything. But at one level… just forget it.’\\n‘What?’ I said.\\n‘At one level, you are hardly a youth writer.’\\nI turned silent and looked at her for a few seconds. Her magnetic eyes  \\nhad a soft but insistent gaze.\\n‘I thought I wrote a book about college kids. That isn’t youth?’ I said.\\n‘Yeah right. So you wrote a book on IIT. A place where so few people  \\nget to go. You think that represents the entire youth? She asked and took out  \\na box of mints from her bag. She offered me one, but I declined. I wanted to  \\nget this straight.\\n‘So what are you trying to say? I had to start somewhere, so I wrote  \\nabout my college experiences. And you know the story is not so IIT-specific. It  \\ncould have happened anywhere.  I mean, just for that you are trashing my  \\nbook.’\\n‘I am not trashing it. I am just saying it hardly represents the Indian  \\nyouth,’ she said and shut the box of mints.\\n‘Oh really… ‘I began, but was interrupted by the noise as the train  \\npassed over a long bridge.\\nWe didn’t speak for the next three minutes, until the train had returned  \\nto smoother tracks. \\n“what represents the youth?’ I said.\\n“I don’t know. You’re the writer. You figure it out,’ she said, and  \\nbrushed aside a few curls that had fallen on her forehead.\\n‘That’s not fair,’ I said, ‘that is so not fair.’ I sounded like a five-year-\\nold throwing a tantrum. She smiled as she saw me grumbling to myself. A few  \\nseconds later, she spoke again.\\n‘Are you going to write more books?’ she said.\\n‘I’ll try to,’ I said. I wasn’t sure if ever wanted to talk to her again.\\n‘So what is it going to be? IIMs this time?’ she said.\\n‘No.’\\n‘Why not?’\\n‘Because it does not represent the country’s youth.’\\nShe stared laughing.\\n‘See, I am taking feedback. And now you laugh at me,’ I said.\\n‘No, no, she said. ‘I am not laughing at you. Can you stop being so over-\\nsensitive?’\\n‘I am not over-sensitive. I just want to take feedback,’ I said and turned  \\nmy face away.\\n‘Well, well now. Let me explain. See, I just felt the whole IITian thing is  \\ncool and all, but what does it all mean in the broader sense? Yes, the book  \\nsells and you get to go to IIT Kanpur. But is that what it is all about?’ she said.\\n“Well, then what is it about?’\\n‘If you want to write the youth, shouldn’t you talk about young people  \\nwho really face challenges? I mean yes, IITians face challenges, but what  \\nabout the hundred and thousand of others/’‘Like whom?’\\n‘Just  look  around  you.  What  is  the  biggest  segment  of  your  facing  \\nchallenges in modern India?’\\n‘I don’t know. Student?’\\n‘Not those, Mr. Writer. Get out of the student-campus of your first book  \\nnow. Anything else you see that you find strange and interesting? I mean,  \\nwhat is the subject of your second novel?’\\nI turned to look at her carefully for the first time. Maybe it was the time  \\nof night, but I kid you not, she was one of the most beautiful women I had  \\never seen. Everything about her was perfect. Her face was like that of a child.  \\nShe wore a bindi, which was hard to focus on as her eyes came in the way.\\nI tried to focus on her question.\\n‘second novel? No, haven’t though of a subject yet,’ I said.\\n‘Really? Don’t you have any ideas?’\\n‘I do. But nothing I am sure about.’\\n‘Inte…resting, she drawled.’ Well, just bask in your first book success  \\nthen.’\\nWe kept quiet for the next half an hour. I took out the contents of my  \\novernight bag and rearranged them for no particular reason. I wondered if it  \\neven made sense to change into a night suit. I was not going to fall asleep  \\nanyway.  Another train noisily  trundled  past us in the opposite direction,  \\nleaving silence behind.\\n‘I might have a story ides for you,’ she said, startling me.\\n‘Huh?’ I was wary of what she was going to say. For no matter what her  \\nidea was, I had to appear interested.\\n‘What is it?’\\n‘It is a story about a call center.’\\n‘Really?’ I said. ‘Call centers as in business process outsourcing centers  \\nor BPOs?’\\n“Yes, do you know anything about them?’\\nI thought about it. I did know about call centers, mostly from my cousins  \\nwho worked there.\\n“Yes, I know a little bit,’ I said. ‘Some 300,000 people work in the  \\nindustry. They help US companies in the sales, service and maintenance of  \\ntheir operations. Usually younger people work there in night shifts. Quite  \\ninteresting, actually.’\\n‘Just interesting? Have you ever thought of what all they have to face?’  \\nshe asked, her voice turning firm again.\\n“Uh, not really…’ I said.\\n‘Why? They aren’t the youth? You don’t want to write about them?’ she  \\nsaid, almost scolding me.\\n‘Listen, let’s not start arguing again…’\\n‘I’m not arguing. I told you that I have a call center story for you.’\\nI looked at my watch. It was 12.30 a.m. A story would not be such a bad  \\nides to kill time, I thought. \\n‘Let’s hear it then, I said.‘I’ll tell you. But I have a condition,’ she said.\\n‘Condition?’ I was intrigued. ‘What? That I don’t tell it to anyone else?’ I  \\nasked.\\n‘No. Just the opposite in fact. You have to promise me to writ it as your  \\nsecond book.’\\n‘What I said, almost falling from my seat.\\nWow! Now that was something. Okay, so I meet a girl who appears  \\ninteresting and has a nice pair of eyes and looks like she can tell me a story to  \\nkill time. However, it does not mean I will spend two years of my life turning  \\nit into a book.\\n‘Like a full book? Are you kidding? I can’t promise that. It’s a lot of  \\nwork,’ I said.\\n‘Up to you,’ she said and turned silent.\\nI waited for ten seconds. She did not speak.\\n‘Can’t I decide after you tell me the story?’ I said. ‘If it is interesting, I  \\nmay even do it. But how can I decide without listening to it?’\\n‘No. it is most about choice. If I tell you, you have to write it,’ she said.\\n‘A whole book…?’ I asked again.\\n‘Yes. Like it’s your own story. In first person—just like in your first  \\nbook. I’ll give you the contacts of the people in the story. You can meet them,  \\ndo your research, whatever it takes, but make it your second book.’\\n‘Well then, I think it’s better if you don’t tell me,’ I said on her berth,  \\nand then arranged her pillow and blanket. I guesses she was planning to go to  \\nsleep.\\nI checked my watch again. It was 1:00 a.m., and I was still wide awake.  \\nThis was a non-stop train, and there were no stations to look forward to until  \\nDelhi in the morning. She switched off the flickering yellow light. Now the  \\nonly light in the compartment was an errie blue one; I couldn’t figure out  \\nwhere the bulb was. It felt strange, like we were the only two people in the  \\nuniverse.\\nAs she was sliding under her blanket, I asked, ‘What is the story about?  \\nAt least tell me a little bit more.’\\n‘Will you do it then?’\\nI shrugged in the semi-darkness. ‘Can’t say.  Don’t tell me the story yet\\n—just tell me what it is about.’\\nShe nodded and sat up. Folding her legs beneath her, she began talking.  \\n‘All right, she said, ‘It is a story about six people in a call center as one  \\nnight.’\\n‘Just one night? Like this one?’ I interrupted.\\n‘Yes, one night. One night at the call center.’\\n‘You sure that can be a full book? I mean, what is so special about this  \\nnight?’\\nShe heaved a sigh and took a sip from her bottle of mineral water. \\n‘You see,’ she said, ‘it wasn’t like any other night. It was the night  \\nthere was a phone call.’‘What?’ I said and burst out laughing. ‘So a call center gets a phone cal.  \\nThat is the special part?’\\nShe did no smile back. She waited fro me to stop laughing and then  \\ncontinued as if I hadn’t said anything. ‘You see, it wasn’t an ordinary phone  \\ncall. It was the night…it was the night there was a phone call from God.’\\nHer words had me spring to attention.\\n‘What?’\\n‘You heard me. That night there was a phone call from God,’ she said.\\n‘What exactly are you talking about?’\\n‘I just told you what the story was about. You asked, remember?’ she  \\nsaid.\\n‘And then… how… I mean…’\\n‘I’m not telling you anymore. Now you know what it’s about, if you want  \\nto hear the story, you know my condition.’\\n‘That is a tough condition,’ I said.\\n‘I know. Up to you,’ she said and lifted her blanket again. She lay down  \\nand closed her eyes.\\nSix people. One night, call center. Call from God. The phrases kept  \\nrepeating in my head as another hour passed. At 2:00 a.m. she woke up to  \\nhave a sip of water.\\n‘Not sleeping?’ she asked, with eyes only half open.\\nMaybe there was a voltage problem, but this time even the blue light in  \\nthe compartment started flickering.\\n‘No, not sleepy at all, I said.\\n‘Okay, goodnight anyway, she said, and began to lie down again.\\n‘Listen,’ I said. Got up. Sit down again.’\\n‘Huh?’ she said, rubbing her eyes. ‘Why? What happened?’\\n‘Nothing. You tell me what happened. Tell me the story’ I said.\\n‘So you will write it?’\\n‘Yes,’ I said, with a bit of hesitation.\\n‘Good,’ she said, and sat up again. The cross-legged position was back.\\nThe rest of the night, she told me the story that begins from the next  \\npage. It is a story about six people, three guys and three girls who worked as  \\nthe Connexions Call Center. I choose to tell the story through Shyam’s eyes.  \\nThis is because, after I met him, I found him the most similar to me as a  \\nperson. The rest of the people and what happened tat night—well, I will let  \\nShyam tell you that.FROM #29\\nOtherwise? Esha Said.\\n‘Otherwise we die,’ Vroom said.\\nWe stayed quiet for a minute.\\n‘Everyone dies one day,’ I said, just to break the silence.\\n‘Maybe it is simpler this way. Just end life rather than deal with it,’  \\nVroom said.\\nI nodded. I was nervous and I was glad Vroom was making small talk.\\n‘My main question is– what if no one finds us even after we die. What  \\nhappens then?’ Vroom said.\\n‘The  vultures  will  find  us.  They  always  do.  I  saw  it  on  Discovery  \\nChannel,’ I said.\\n‘See, that makes me uncomfortable. I don’t like the idea of sharp beaks  \\nrearing my muscles, cracking my bones and ripping me to shreds. Plus, my  \\nbody will be smelling like hell. I’d rather be burnt in a dignified manner and  \\ngo up in that one last ultimate puff of smoke.’\\n‘Can you guys stop this nonsense? At least be silent,’ Esha said and  \\nfolded her arms.\\nVroom smiled at her. Then he turned to me. “I don’t thinking Esha will  \\nsmell too much. Her Calvin Klein perfume will keep her carcass fresh for  \\ndays.’#1\\nI was splashing my hands in the water pointlessly in the sea. I can’t even  \\nswim in a pond, let alone in the Indian Ocean. I was in the water while my  \\nboss Bakshi was in a boat next to me. He was pushing my head down in the  \\nwater. I saw Priyanka drifting away in a lifeboat. I screamed even as Bakshi  \\nused both his hands to keep my head submerged. Salt water filled my mouth  \\nand nostrils as I heard loud beeps at a distance.\\nMy nightmare ended as my cell phone alarm rang hard in my left ear and  \\nI woke up to its Last Christmas ring tone. The ring tone was a gift from  \\nShefali, my new semi-girlfriend. I squinted through a half-shut eye and lifted  \\non the screen.\\n‘Damn,’ I said and jumped out of bed.\\nI would have loved to analyze my dream and its significance in my  \\ninsignificant life, but I had to get dressed for work.\\n‘Man, the Qualis will be here in twenty minutes,’ I thought, digging  \\nmatter out of my eye. I was still tired, but scared to sleep more because I was  \\ngetting late. Besides, there was a serious risk of Bakshi making a comeback in  \\nmy dreams.\\nBy the way, hi. I am Shyam Mehra, or Sam Marcy as they call me at my  \\nworkplace, the Connexions call center in Gurgaon. (American tongues have  \\ntrouble saying my real name and prefer Sam. If you want, you can give me  \\nanother name too. I really don’t care.)\\nAnyway, I am a call center agent. There was hundred of thousands,  \\nprobably millions of agents like me. But this total pain-in-the neck author  \\nchose me, of all the agents in the country. He met me and told me to help  \\nwith his second book. In fact, he near as well wanted me to write the book for  \\nhim. I declined, saying I can’t even write my resume or even other simple  \\nthings in life, there is no way I can write a whole damn book. I explained to  \\nhim how my promotion to the position of team leader had been put off for  \\none year because my manager Bakshi had told me I don’t have the ‘required  \\nskill-set’s yet. In my review, Bakshi wrote that I was ‘not a go-getter’. (I don’t  \\neven know what ‘go-getter’ means, so I guess I’m not one for sure.)\\nBut this author said he didn’t care—he had promised someone he’d do  \\nthis story so I’d better cooperate, otherwise he would keep pestering me. I  \\ntried my best to wriggle out of it, but he wouldn’t let go of me. I finally  \\nrelented and that’s why I’m stuck with this assignment, while you are stuck  \\nwith me.\\nI also want to give you one more warning. My English is not that great—\\nactually, nothing about me is great. So, if you are looking for something posh  \\nand highbrow, then I’d suggest you read another book which has some big  \\nmany-syllabus words. I know only one big, many-syllable word, and I hate that  \\nword—‘management’. But we’ll get to that later. I told the author about my  \\nlimited English. However, the pain-in-the-neck author said big emotions do  \\nnot come from big words. So, I had no choice but to do the job. I hate  authors. For now, let us go back to the story. If you remember, I had just  \\nwoken up at my home.\\nThere were noises in the living room. Some relatives were in town to  \\nattend a family wedding. My neighbor was getting married to his cousin…er  \\nsorry, I was too groggy to figure this out—no, my cousin was getting married to  \\nhis neighbor. But I had to work, so I could not go to the wedding. It doesn’t  \\nmatter, all marriages are the same, more or less.\\nI reached the bathroom still half-asleep, it was already occupied.\\nThe bathroom door was open. I saw five of my aunts scrambling to get a  \\nfew  square-inches  of  the  wash-basin  mirror.  One  aunt  was  cursing  her  \\ndaughter for leaving the matching bindis at home. Another aunt had lost the  \\nlittle screw of her gold earring and was flipping out.\\n‘It is pure gold, where is it?’ she screamed into my face. ‘Has the maid  \\nstolen it?’ like the maid had nothing better to do then steal one tiny screw.  \\nWouldn’t she steal the whole set? I thought.\\n‘Auntie, can I use the bathroom for five minutes. I need to get ready for  \\noffice,’ I said.\\n‘Oh hello, Shyam. Woke up finally?’ my mother’s sister said. ‘Office?  \\nYou are not coming for the wedding?’\\n‘No, I have to work. Can I have the bath…’\\n‘Look how big Shyam has become,’ my maternal aunt said. ‘We need to  \\nfind a girl for him soon.’\\nEveryone burst into giggles. It was their biggest joke of the day.\\n‘Can I please…’ I said.\\n‘Shyam, leave the ladies alone,’ one of my older cousins interrupted.  \\n‘What are you doing here with the women? We are already so late for the  \\nwedding’\\n‘But I have to go to work. I need to get dressed,’ I protested, trying to  \\nelbow my way to the bathroom tap.\\n‘You work in a call center, right? My cousin said.\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘Your work is through the phone. Why do you need to dress up? Who is  \\ngoing to see you?’\\nI didn’t answer.\\n‘Use  the  kitchen  sink,’  an  aunt  suggested  and  handed  me  my  \\ntoothbrush.\\nI gave them all a dirty look. Nobody noticed. I passed by the living room  \\non my way to the kitchen. The uncles were outside, on their second whiskey  \\nand soda. One uncle said something about how it would be better if my father  \\nwere still alive and around this evening.\\nI reached the kitchen. The floor was so cold I felt I had stepped on an  \\nice tray. I realized I had forgotten soap. I went back but the bathroom door  \\nwas bolted. There was no hot water in the kitchen, and my face froze as I  \\nwashed it with cold water. Winter in Delhi is a bitch. I brushed my teeth and  used the steel plates as a mirror to comb my hair. Shyam had turned into Sam  \\nand Sam’s day had just begun.\\nI was hungry, but there was nothing to eat in the house. Because they’d  \\nbe getting food at the wedding, my mother had felt there was no need to cook  \\nat home. \\nThe Qualis horn screamed at 8.55 p.m.\\nAs I was about to leave, I realized I had forgotten my ID. I went to my  \\nroom, but could not find it. I tried to find my mother instead. She was in her  \\nbedroom, lost in more aunties, saris and jewellery sets. She and my aunts  \\nwere doing some major weight comparisons of which aunt’s set was heaviest.  \\nUsually the heaviest aunt had the heaviest set.\\n‘Mom, have you seen my ID?’ I said. Everyone ignored me. I went back  \\nto my room as the Qualis honked for the fourth time.\\n‘Damn, there it is,’ I said as I finally located the ID under my bed. I  \\npulled it out by its strap and strung it around my neck.\\nI waved a goodbye to everyone, but no on acknowledged me. It wasn’t  \\nsurprising, I am only cared for so much. Every cousin of mine is becoming a  \\ndoctor or engineer. You can say I am the black sheep of my family. Though I  \\ndo not think that I expression is correct. After all, what’s wrong with black  \\nsheep—don’t people wear black sweaters? But you get an idea of my status in  \\nmy clan. In fact, the only reason people somewhat talk to me is I have a job  \\nand get a salary at the end of the month. You see, I used to work in the  \\nwebsite department of an ad agency before this call center job. However, the  \\nad agency paid horrible money. Also, all the people there were pseudos, more  \\ninterested in office politics than websites. I quit, and all hell broke loose at  \\nhome. That is when the black sheep term was tagged onto me. I saved myself  \\nby joining Connexions, as with money in your wallet the world gives you some  \\nrespect and lets Priyanka worked there. Of course, that reason was no longer  \\nrelevant.\\nMy aunt finally found the gold screw tapped in her fake hair bun.\\nThe Qualis horn screamed again, this time in an agency tone.\\n‘I’m coming,’ I shouted as I ran out of the house.#2\\n‘What sahib. Late again?’ The driver said as I took the front seat.\\n‘Sorry, sorry. Military Uncle’s place first?’ I panted to the driver.\\n‘Yes,’ he replied, looking at his watch.\\n‘Can we reach the call center by 10:00 p.m.? I have to meet someone  \\nbefore their shift ends,’ I said.\\n‘Depends  if  your  colleagues  come  on  time,’  the  driver  replied  \\nlaconically as he drove towards Military Uncle’s house. ‘Anyway, let’s pick up  \\nthe old man first.’\\nMilitary Uncle hates it if we are late. I prepared myself for some dirty  \\nlooks. His tough manner comes from the Army background, from which he  \\nretired a few years ago. A fifty plus, he is the oldest person in the call center.  \\nI do not know him well, and I won’t talk about him much. But I do know that  \\nhe used to stay with his son and daughter-in-law before he moved one ( read—\\nthrown out) to be on his own. The pension was meager, and he tried to  \\nsupplement his income by working in the call center. However, he hates to  \\ntalk and is not a voice agent. He sits on the solitary online chat and email  \\nstation. Even though he sits in our room, his desk is at a far corner near the  \\nfax machine. He rarely speaks more than three words at a time. Most of his  \\ninteractions with us are limited to giving us condescending you-young-people  \\nglances.\\nThe  Qualis  stopped  outside  Uncle’s  house.  He  was  waiting  at  the  \\nentrance.\\n‘Late?’ Uncle said, looking at the driver.\\nWithout answering, the driver got out to open the Qualis back door.  \\nUncle climbed in, ignored the middle seat and sat at the back. He probably  \\nwanted to sit as far away from me as possible.\\nUncle gave me an  it-must-be-your-fault  look. Older people think they  \\nhave a natural right to judge you. I looked away. The driver took a U-turn to  \\ngo to Radhika’s house.\\nOne of the unique features about my team is that we not only work  \\ntogether, we also share the same Qualis. Through a bit of route planning and  \\ndriver persuasion, we ensured that my Western Appliances Strategic Group all  \\ncame and left together. There are six of us: Military Uncle, Radhika, Esha,  \\nVroom, Priyanka and me.\\nThe Qualis moved to Radhika Jha, or agent Regina Jones’s house. As  \\nusual, Radhika was late.\\n‘Radhika madam is too much,’ the driver said, continuously pressing the  \\nhorn.  I  looked  at  my  watch  anxiously.  I  didn’t  want  Shefali  to  throw  a  \\ntantrum. \\nSix minutes later Radhika came running towards us, clutching the ends  \\nof her maroon shawl in her right hand.\\n‘Sorry,  sorry  sorry…’  she  said  a  dozen  times  before  we  could  say  \\nanything.‘What?’ I asked her as the Qualis moved again.\\n‘Nothing.  Almost  milk  for  mom-in-law.  Took  longer  to  crush  the  \\nalmonds,’ she said, learning back exhausted in her seat. She had taken the  \\nmiddle seat.\\n‘Ask mom-in-law to make her own milk,’ I suggested.\\n‘C’mon Shyam,’ she said, ‘she’s so old, it is the least I can do, especially  \\nwhen her son is not here.’\\n‘Yeah right,’ I shrugged.  ‘Just that and cooking three meals a day and  \\nhousehold chores and working all night and…’\\n‘Shh…’ she said,’forge all that. Any news on the call centre? I’m scared.’\\n‘Nothing new from what Vroom told me. We have to new orders, call  \\nvolumes are at an all time low— Connexions is doomed. Just a question of  \\nwhen,’ I said.\\n‘Really?’ her eyes widened.\\nIt was true. You might have heard of those swanky, new-age call centers  \\nwhere  everything  is  hunky-dory,  clients  are  plenty  and  agents  get  \\naromatherapy massage. Well, our Connexions was not one of them. We live  \\noff one and only one client—Western Computers and Appliances. And even  \\ntheir call flow had dwindled. Rumors that the call center would collapse  \\nfloated in every day.\\n‘You thing Connexions will close down? Like forever?’ Radhika asked. \\nUncle raised an eyebrow to look at us, but soon went back to brooding  \\nby himself in the back seat. I sometimes wished he would say more, but I  \\nguess it’s better for people to shut up rather than say something nasty.\\n‘That, or they will do major job cuts. Ask Vroom.’ I said.\\nThe Qualis moved painfully slow as it was a heavy wedding date in Delhi.  \\nOn every street, there was a wedding procession. We edged forward as the  \\ndriver dodged several fat grooms on their own-burdened horses. I checked the  \\ntime again. Shefali would do some serious sulking today.\\n‘I need this job. Anuj and I need to save.’ Radhika said, more to herself.  \\nAnuj  was  Radhika’s  husband.  She  married  him  three  years  ago  after  a  \\nwhirlwind courtship in college. She now lived in a joint family with Anuj’s  \\nultra-traditional parents. It was tough for daddy’s only girl, but it’s amazing  \\nwhat people do for love.\\nThe driver drove to Esha Singh’s (agent Eliza Singer’s) place next. She  \\nwas already outside her house. The driver kept the Qualis ignition on as he  \\nopened the back door.\\nEsha entered the Qualis and the smell of expensive perfume filled the  \\nvehicle. She sat next to Radhika in the middle row and removed her suede  \\njacket.\\n‘Mmm…nice. What is it?’ Radhika said.\\n‘You noticed…’ Esha was pleased. ‘Escape, by Calvin Klein.’ She bent  \\nher knees and adjusted the tassels at the end of her long, dark brown skirt.\\n‘Oooh. Went shopping?’ Radhika said.\\n‘Call it a momentary laps of reason,’ Esha said.The driver finally reached a stretch of empty road and raced the Qualis  \\nfast.\\nI looked at Esha again. Her dress sense is impeccable. Esha dresses  \\nbetter on an average day than I ever did in my whole life. Her sleeveless  \\ncoffee-colored  top  perfectly  contrasted  with  her  skirt.  She  wore  chunky  \\nbrown earrings that looked edible and her lipstick was a thick cocoa, as is she  \\nhad just kissed a bowl of chocolate sauce. Her eyes had at least one of these  \\nthings—mascara, eyeliner and/or eye-shadow (I can’t tell, but Priyanka told  \\nme they are different things).\\n‘The Lakme fashion week is in four months. My agent is trying to get me  \\nan assignment,’ Esha said to Radhika.\\nEsha wanted to become a model. She was hot, at least according to  \\npeople at the call center. Two months ago, some agents in the Western  \\nComputers bay conducted a stupid poll in office. You know, the secret ones  \\nthat everyone knows about anyway. People vote for various titles, like who is  \\nhot, who is handsome and who is pretty. Esha won the title of the ‘hottest  \\nchick at Connexions’. She acted very dismissive of the poll results, but from  \\nthat day there’s been just this tiny hint of vanity in her. But otherwise, she is  \\nfine. She moved to Delhi from Chandigarh a year ago, against her parent’s  \\nwishes. The call center job helps her earn a regular income, but during the  \\nday she approached agencies and tries to get modeling assignments. She’s  \\ntaken part in some low-key fashion shows in West Delhi. But apart from that  \\nand the hottest-chick in-house title, nothing big has come her way so far.  \\nPriyanka once told me (making me swear that I’d keep it to myself) that she  \\nthinks Esha will never make it as a real model. ‘ Esha is too short and too  \\nsmall-town for a real model ’—is what she said exactly. But Priyanka doesn’t  \\nknow crap. Esha is five-five, only two inches shorter than me (and one inch  \\ntaller than me with her heels). I think that is quite tall for a girl. And the  \\nwhole ‘small-town’ thing, that just went over my head. Esha is only twenty-\\ntwo, give her a chance. And Chandigarh is not a small town, it is a union  \\nterritory  and  the  administrative  capital  of  two  states.  But  Priyanka’s  \\ngeography is crap as well. I think Priyanka is just jealous. All non-hot girls are  \\njealous of the hot ones. Priyanka wasn’t even considered for the hottest  \\nchick. Now I do find Priyanka nice looking, and she did get a nomination for  \\nthe ‘call center cutie award’, which I think is just because of her dimples and  \\ncure round face. But Priyanka didn’t win. Some girl in HR won that.\\nWe had to pick Vroom next; his real name is Varun Malhotra (of agent  \\nVictor Mell). However, everyone calls him Vroom because of his love for  \\nanything on wheels.\\nThe Qualis turned into the lane for Vroom’s house. He was sitting on his  \\nbike, waiting for us.\\n‘What’s the bike for?’ I said, craning out of the window.\\n‘I’m coming on my own,’ Vroom said, adjusting his leather gloves. He  \\nwore black jeans and trekking shows that made his thin legs look extra long.  \\nHis dark blue sweatshirt had the Ferrari horse logo on it.\\n‘Are you crazy?’ I said. ‘it’s so cold. Get in, we’re late already.’Dragging the bike he came and stood next to me.\\n‘No, I’m stressed today. I need to get it out of me with a fast ride.’ He  \\nwas standing right beside me and only I could hear him.\\n‘What happened?’\\n‘Nothing. Dad called. He argued with mom for two hours. Why did they  \\nseparate? They can’t live without screaming their guts out at each other?’\\n‘It’s okay man. Not your problem,’ I said.\\nVroom’s dad was a businessmen who parted from his wife two years  \\nago. He preferred banging his secretary to being with his family, so Vroom and  \\nhis mother now lived without him.\\n‘I couldn’t sleep at all. Just lay in bed all day and now I feel sick. Need  \\nto get some energy back,’ Vroom said as he straddled his bike.\\n‘But it’s freezing, dude…’ I began.\\n‘What is going on Shyam sahib?’ the driver asked. I turned around. The  \\ndriver looked at me with a puzzled expression. I shrugged my shoulders.\\n‘He’s coming on his bike,’ I told everyone.\\n‘Come with me,’ Vroom said to me. ‘I’ll make you reach in half the  \\ntime.’\\n‘No thanks,’ I said, and folded my hands. I was not leaving the cozy  \\nQualis to go anywhere.\\nVroom bent over to greet the driver.\\n‘Hello, driver sahib,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Vroom  sahib,  don’t  you  like  my  Qualis?’  the  driver  said,  visibly  \\ndejected.\\n‘No Driver ji, I am in a mood to ride,’ Vroom said, and offered a pack of  \\ncigarettes to the driver. The driver took one. Vroom signaled him to keep the  \\nwhole pack.\\n‘Drive the Qualis if you want,’ the driver said and lifted his hands off  \\nthe steering wheel.\\n‘No maybe later. Right now I need to fly.’\\n‘Hey Vroom. Any news on Connexions? Anything happening?’ Radhika  \\nasked, adjusting her hair.\\nApart from the dark circles around her eyes, you would say Radhika was  \\npretty. She had high cheekbones and her fair skin went well with her wispy  \\neyebrows and soot-black eyes. Her sleep-deprived face still looked nice. She  \\nwore a plain mustard sari, as saris were all she could wear in her in-laws’  \\nhouse. This was different apparel from the jeans and skirts Radhika preferred  \\nbefore her marriage.\\n‘No updates. Will dig for stuff today but I think Bakshi will screw us all.  \\nHey Shyam, the website manual is all done by the way. I emailed it to office,’  \\nVroom said and started his bike.\\n‘Cool, finally. Let’s send it in today,’ I said, perking up.\\nWe left Vroom and moved to out last pickup at Priyanka’s place. It was  \\n9.30 p.m. still an hour away from our shift. However, I was worried as Shefali  \\nfinished her shift and left by 10:20 p.m.Fortunately,  Priyanka  was  standing  at  her  pick-up  point  when  we  \\nreached her place.\\n‘Hi,’ Priyanka said, as she entered the Qualis and sat next to Esha in the  \\nmiddle seat. She carried a large, white plastic bag apart from her usual giant  \\nhandbag.\\n‘Hi,’ everyone replied except me.\\n‘I said hi, Shyam,’ Priyanka said.\\nI pretended not to hear. It is strange, but even since we broke up, I find  \\nit difficult to talk to her. Even though I must think of her thirty times a day.\\nI looked at her. She adjusted her dupatta around her neck. The forest  \\ngreen salwar kameez she was wearing was new, I noticed. The colors suited  \\nher light brown skin. I looked at her nose and her nostrils that flared up every  \\ntime she was upset. I swear tiny flames appeared in them when she was mad.\\n‘Shyam, I said hi,‘ she said again. She gets really pissed if people don’t  \\nrespond to her.\\n‘hi,’ I said. I wondered if Bakshi would finally promote me after he saw  \\nmy website manual tonight.\\n‘Where’s Vroom?’ Priyanka said. She had to know everything all the  \\ntime.\\n‘Vroom is riding…vroom,’ Esha said, making a motorbike noise.\\n‘Nice perfume, Esha. Shopping again, eh?’ Priyanka said and sniffed,  \\npuckering up that tiny nose.\\n‘Escape, Calvin Klein,’ Esha announced and struck a pose.\\n‘Wow! Someone is going  designer,’ Priyanka said  and  both of them  \\nlaughed. This is something I will never understand about her. Priyanka has  \\nbitched fifty times about Esha to me, yet when they are with each other, they  \\nbehave like long-lost sisters.\\n‘Esha, big date coming?’ Radhika said.\\n‘No dates. I’m still so single. Suitable guys are an endangered species,’  \\nEsha said and all the girls laughed. It wasn’t that funny if you ask me. I wished  \\nVroom was in the Qualis too. He is the only person in my team I can claim as a  \\nfriend. At twenty-two he is four years younger than I am, but I will find it  \\neasiest to talk to him. Radhika’s household talk is too alien to me. Esha’s  \\nmodeling trip is also beyond me as no one is ever going to pay me for the  \\nlooks. I am certainly not good looking: my day is made if someone describes  \\nmy looks as ‘slightly above average’. \\nPriyanka was a friend and a lot moiré until recently. Four months ago,  \\nwe broke up (Priyanka’s version) or she dumped me (my version).\\nSo now I try to do what she wants us to do—‘move on’—which is why I  \\nhang out with Shefali.\\nBeep Beep. Beep Beep.\\nTwo pairs of loud beeps from my shift’s pocket startled everyone.\\n‘Who’s is that?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Oh Sorry. It’s my SMS.’ I said and opened the new message.\\nWhere r u my eddy teddy?Come soon-curly wurly\\nIt was Shefali. She is into cheesy nicknames these days. I replied to the  \\nSMS.\\nQualis stuck in traffic\\nWill b there soon\\n‘Who’s that?’ Esha asked me.’\\n‘Nobody important,’ I said.\\n‘Shefali?’ Radhika said.\\n‘No,’ I said and everybody looked at me.\\n‘No,’ I said again.\\n‘Yes, it is. It is Shefali, isn’t it,’ Esha and Radhika said together and  \\nlaughed.\\n‘Why does Shefali always babytalk?’ I heard Esha whisper to Radhika.  \\nMore titters followed.\\n‘Whatever,’ I said and looked at my watch. The Qualis was still on the  \\nNH8,  at  the  entrance  to  Gurgaon.  We  were  ten  minutes  away  from  \\nConnexions.\\n‘Cool, will meet Shefali by 10:10, I thought.\\n‘Can we stop for a quick tea at Inderjeet? We will still make it by  \\n10:30,’ Priyanka said. Inderjeet dhabha on NH8 was famous for its all-night  \\ntea and snacks among truck drivers.\\n‘We won’t get late?’ Radhika crinkled her forehead.\\n‘Of course not. Driver  Ji asked saved us twenty minutes in the last  \\nstretch. Come Driver ji, my treat,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Good idea. Will keep me awake,’ Esha said.\\nThe driver slowed the Qualis near Inderjeet dhabha and parked it near  \\nthe counter.\\n‘Hey guys, do we have to stop? We will get late,’ I protested against the  \\nchai chorus.\\n‘We won’t get late. Let’s treat Driver  ji for making us reach fast,’  \\nPriyanka said and got out of the Qualis. She just has to do things I don’t want  \\nto do.\\n‘He  wants  to  be  with  Shefali,  dude,’  Esha  elbowed  Radhika.  They  \\nguffawed again. What is so damn funny, I wants to ask, but didn’t.\\n‘No, I just like to reach my shift a few minutes early,’ I said and got out  \\nof the Qualis. Military Uncle and the driver followed us.\\nInderjeet  dhabha  had  angithis next  to  each  table.  I  smelled  hot  \\nparanthas, but did not order as it was getting late. The driver arranged plastic  \\nchairs for us. Inderjeet’s minions collected tea orders as per the various  \\ncomplicated rules laid out by the girls.\\n‘No sugar in mine,’ Esha said.\\n‘Extra hot for me,’ Radhika said.\\n‘With cardamom for me,’ Priyanka said.When we were in college together, Priyanka used to make cardamom  \\ntea for me in her hostel room. Her taste in men might have changed, but  \\nobviously not her taste in beverages.\\nThe tea arrived in three minutes.\\n‘So what’s the gossip?’ Priyanka said as cupped her hands around the  \\nglass for warmth. Apart from cardamom, Priyanka’s favourite spice is gossip.\\n‘No gossip. You tell us, things are happening I your life,’ Radhika said.\\n‘I actually do have something to tell,’ Priyanka said with a sly smile.\\n‘What?’ Radhika and Esha exclaimed together.\\n‘I’ll tell you when we get to the bay. It’s big,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Tell now,’ Esha said, poking Priyanka’s shoulder.\\n‘No time. Someone is in a desperate hurry,’ Priyanka said  glancing  \\nmeaningfully at me.\\nI turned away.\\n‘Okay, I also have something to share. But don’t tell anyone, Esha said.\\n‘What?’ Radhika said.\\n‘See, Esha said and stood up. She raised her top to expose a flat midriff\\n—on which there was a newborn ring.\\n‘Cool, check it out,’ Priyanka said, ‘someone’s turning trendy.’\\nMilitary Uncle stared as if in a state of shock. I suspect he was never  \\nyoung, was just born straight forty years old.\\n‘What’s that? A navel ring?’ Radhika asked.\\nEsha nodded and covered herself again.\\n‘Did it hurt?’ Radhika said.\\n‘Oh yes,’ Esha said. ‘Imagine someone stapling your tummy hard.’\\nEsha’s statement churned my stomach.\\n‘Shall we go,’ I said, gulping down my tea.\\n‘Let’s go girls, or Mr Conscientious will get upset,’ Priyanka suppressed  \\na smirk. I hate her.\\nI went to the counter to pay the bill. I saw Vroom watching TV.\\n‘Vroom?’ I said.\\n‘Hi. What are you guys doing here?’ he said.\\nI told about the girls’ tea idea.\\n‘I arrived twenty minutes ago man,’ Vroom said. He extinguished his  \\ncigarette and showed me that butt. ‘This was my first.’\\nVroom was trying to cut down to four cigarettes a night. However, with  \\nBakshi in our life, it was impossible.\\n‘Can you rush me to the call center? Shefali will leave soon,’ I said.\\nVroom’s eyes were  transfixed  on the  TV set  on Inderjeet dhabha’s  \\ncounter. The NDTV news channel was on, and Vroom is a sucker for it. He  \\nworked in a newspaper once and is generally into social and global issues and  \\nall that stuff. He thinks that just by watching the news, he can change the  \\nworld. That, by the way, is his trip.\\nA TV reporter was speaking in front of Parliament house, announcing  \\nelections in four months.\\n‘Hey, I know that guy. He used to work in my previous job,’ Vroom said.‘The newspaper?’\\n‘Yes, Boontoo we used to call him—total loser guy. Didn’t know he  \\nmoved to television. Check out his contact lenses,’ Vroom said, as both of us  \\npaid the bill.\\n‘Let’s go, man. Shefali will kill me.’\\n‘Shefali. Oh you mean curly wurly,’ Vroom laughed.\\n‘Shut up man. She has to catch the Qualis after her shift. This is the  \\nonly time I get with her.’\\n‘On one hand you had Priyanka, and now you sink to Shefali levels,’  \\nVroom said, and bent his elbow to rest his six-feet-two-inches frame on the  \\ndhabha counter.\\n‘What’s wrong with Shefali?’ I said, shuffling from one foot to the other.\\n‘Nothing, just that it is nice to have a girlfriend with half a brain. Why  \\nare you wasting your time with her?’\\nI’m waning myself off Priyanka. I’m trying to move on in life,’ I said and  \\ntook a sweat from the candy jar at the counter.\\n‘So what’s Shefali, a pacifier? What happened to the re-proposal plan  \\nwith Priyanka?’ Vroom said.\\n‘I’ve told you. Not until I become team leader. Which should be soon—\\nmaybe tonight after me submit the website manual. Now can we please go?’ I  \\nsaid.\\n‘Yeah, right. Some hopes you live on,’ Vroom said, but moved away  \\nfrom the counter. \\nI held on tight as Vroom zipped through NH8 at 120 km an hour. I closed  \\nmy eyes and prayed Shefali would not be mad, and that I would teach alive. \\nBeep Beep. Beep Beep. My mobile went off again.\\nCurly wurly is sad\\nEddy teddy is very bad\\nI leave in 10 min : (\\nI jumped off the bike as Vroom reached the call center. The bike jerked  \\nforward and Vroom had to use both his legs to balance.\\n‘Easy man. Vroom said in an irritated voice. ‘Can you just let me park?’\\n‘Sorry. I’m really late,’ I said and ran inside.#3\\n‘I’m not talking to you,’ Shefali said and started playing with one of her  \\nsilver earrings. The ring-shaped earrings were so large, they could be bangles.\\n‘Sorry Shefali. My bay people made the Qualis late.’ I stood next to her,  \\nleaning against her desk. She sat on her swivel chair and rotated it ninety  \\ndegrees away from me to showcase her sulking. The dozens of workstations in  \\nher bay were empty as all the other agents had left.\\n‘Whatever.  I  thought  you  were  their  team  leader,’  she  said  and  \\npretended to work on her computer.\\n‘I am not the team leader. I am due, but not one yet,’ I said.\\n‘Why don’t they make you team leader?’ she turned to me and fluttered  \\nher eyes. I hate this expression of hers.\\n‘I don’t know. Bakshi said he’s trying, but I have to bring my leadership  \\nskills up to speed.’\\n‘What is up to speed?’ she said and opened her handbag.\\n‘I don’t know. Improve my skills I guess.’\\n‘So you guys don’t have any team leader.’\\n‘No. Bakshi says we have to manage without one. I help with supervisory  \\nstuff for now. But Bakshi told me I have strong future potential.’\\n‘So why doesn’t your team listen to you?’\\n‘Who says they don’t? Of course they do.’\\n‘So why were you late/’ she said, beginning her sentence with a ‘so; for  \\nthe third time.\\n‘Shefali come on, drop that,’ I said, looking at my watch. ‘How did your  \\nshift go?’\\n‘Shift  was  okay.  Team  leader  said  call  volumes  have  dropped  for  \\nWestern  Computers.  All  customers  are  using  the  troubleshooting  website  \\nnow.’\\n‘Cool. You do know who made that right?’\\n‘Yes, you and Vroom. But I don’t think you should make a big deal out of  \\nit. The website has cost Connexions a lot of business.’\\n‘But the website helps the customers a lost, right?’ I said.\\n‘Shh. Don’t talk about the website here. Some agents are very upset.  \\nSomeone said they would cut people.’\\n‘Really?’\\n‘I don’t know. Listen, why are you so unromantic? Is this how Eddy  \\nTeddy should talk to his Curly Wurly/’\\nI wanted to know more about what was going on at Connexions. Bakshi  \\nwas  super-secretive—all  the  said  was  there  were  some  confidential  \\nmanagement priorities. I thought of asking Vroom to spy some more.\\n‘Eddy Teddy?’ Shefali repeated. I looked at her. If she stopped wearing  \\nHello Kitty hairpins, she could be passably cute.\\n‘Huh?’\\n‘Are you listening to me?’‘Of course.’\\n‘Did you like my gift/’\\n‘What gift?’\\n‘The  ring  tones.  I  gave  you  six  rings  tones.  See,  you  don’t  even  \\nremember,’ she said and her face turned sad.\\n‘I do. See I put  Last Christmas  as my tone,’ I said and picked up my  \\nphone to play it. Vroom would probably kill me if he heard it, but I had to for  \\nShefali.\\n‘So cute,’ Shefali said and pinched my cheeks. ‘So cute it sounds, my  \\nEddy teddy.’\\n‘Shefali…’\\n‘What?’\\n‘Can you stop calling me that/’\\n‘Why/ you don’t like it?’\\n‘Just call me Shyam.’\\n‘You don’t like the name I gave you?’ she said, her voice transcending  \\nfrom sad to tragic.\\nI kept quiet. You never tell women you don’t like something they have  \\ndone. However, they pick up on the silence.\\n‘That means you don’t like the ring tones either,’ she said and her voice  \\nstarted to break.\\n‘I do,’ I said, fearing a round of crying. ‘I love the ring tones.’\\n‘And what about the name? You can choose another name if you want. I  \\nam not like your other girlfriends,’ she said and tiny tears appeared in her  \\neyes.  I  looked  at  my  watch.  There  more  minutes  and  time  will  heal  \\neverything. I thought. I took a deep breath. A hundred and eighty seconds and  \\nshe would have to leave for sure. Sometimes counting seconds is a great way  \\nto kill time through woman’s tantrums.\\n‘What kind of girlfriends/’ I said.\\n‘Like,’ she sniffed, ‘bossy girls who impose their way on you. Like you-\\nknow-who.’\\n‘Who?’ What are you implying,’ I said, my voice getting firmer. It was  \\ntrue; Priyanka could be bossy, but only if you didn’t listen to her.\\n‘Forget it. But will you give me a name if I stop crying?’ her sobs were at  \\na serious risk of transforming into a full-fledged bawl.\\n‘yes,’ I said and became normal. ‘Give me a name,’ \\nI though hard. Nothing came to mind.\\n‘Sheffy? How about Sheffy?’ I said finally.\\n‘Nooo. I want something cuteeer,’ she said. Shefali loves to drag out  \\nwords.\\n‘I can’t of anything cute right now. I have to work. Isn’t your Qualis  \\nleaving soon too?’ I said.\\nShe looked at her watch and stood up.\\n‘Yes, I better leave now. Will you think of a name by tomorrow?’ she  \\nsaid.\\n‘I will, bye now.’‘Give me a kissie,’ she said and tapped a finger on her cheek. \\n‘What?’\\n‘Kissie.’\\n‘You mean a kiss? Yeah sure.’ I gave her a peck on the check and turned  \\naround to return to my bay.\\n‘Bye bye. Eddy Teddy,’ her voice followed me.#4\\nThe others were already at the desk when I returned from Shefali’s bay.\\nOur bay’s name is the ‘Western Appliances Strategic Group’ or WASG.  \\nUnlike the other bay that troubleshoots for computer customers, we deal with  \\ncustomers  of  home  appliances  such  as  refrigerators,  ovens  and  vacuum  \\ncleaners. Management calls us the strategic bay because we specialize in  \\ntroublesome and painful customers. These ‘strategic’ customers call a lot and  \\nare too dumb to figure out things (actually the latter applies to a lot of  \\ncallers).\\nWe fell special, as we are not part of the main computers bay. The main  \\nbay has over a thousand agents and handles the huge ‘Western Computers’  \\naccount. While the calls are less weird there, they miss the privacy we enjoy  \\nin the WASG.\\nI came and took my seat at the long rectangular table. We have a fixed  \\nseating arrangement: I sit next to Vroom, while Priyanka is right opposite me;  \\nEsha is adjacent to Priyanka and Radhika sits next to Esha. The bay is an open  \\nplan, so we can all see each others. Military Uncle’s chat station is at the  \\ncorner  of  the  room.  At  each  of  the  other  three  corners,  there  are,  \\nrespectively,  the  restroom,  a  conference  room  and  a  stationery  supplies  \\nroom.\\nHowever, no one apart from Uncle was at their seat when I sat down.  \\nEveryone had gathered around Priyanka.\\n‘What’s the news? Tell us now,’ Esha was saying.\\n‘Okay, okay. But on one condition. It doesn’t leave the WASG,’ Priyanka  \\nsaid, sitting down. She pulled out a large plastic bag from under her seat.\\n‘Guys,’ I said, interrupting their banter.\\nEveryone turned to look at me.\\nI pointed at the desk and the unmanned phones. I looked at my watch.  \\nIt was 10:29 p.m. The call system routine backup was about to finish, and our  \\ncalls would begin in a minute.\\nEveryone returned to their chairs and put on their headsets.\\n‘Good evening, everyone. Please pay attention to this announcement,’ a  \\nloud voice filled our bay. I looked up. The voice came from the fire drill  \\nspeaker.\\n‘I hate this irritating announcement,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘This is the control room,’ the speaker continued. ‘This is to inform all  \\nagents of a fire drill next Friday at midnight. Please follow instructions during  \\nthe fire drill to leave the call center safely. Thank you. Have a nice shift.’\\n‘Why do they keep doing this? Nobody is going to burn this place down,’  \\nEsha said.\\n‘Government rules,’ Vroom said.\\nConversations stopped mid-way as two begs on the computer screens  \\nsignaled the start of our shift.Calls began at 10”31 p.m. Numbers started flashing on our common  \\nswitchboard as we picked up calls one after the other. \\n‘Good afternoon, Western Appliances, Victor speaking, how may I help  \\nyou?’ Vroom said as he took one of his first calls.\\n‘Yes, according to my records I am speaking to Ms Smith, and you have  \\nthe WAF-200 dishwasher. Is that right?’ Esha said.\\nEsha’s ‘memory’ impressed the caller. It was not a big deal, given that  \\nour  automated  system  had  every  caller’s  records.  We  knew  their  name,  \\naddress, credit card details and past purchases from Western Appliances. We  \\nalso had details on when they last called us. In fact, the reason why her call  \\nhad come to our desk—the Western Appliances Strategic desk—was because  \\nshe was a persistent caller. This way the main bay could continue to run  \\nsmoothly.\\nSometimes  we  had  customers  that  were  oddballs  even  by  WASG  \\nstandards. I will not go into all of them, but Vroom’s 10:37 p.m. call went  \\nsomething like this:\\n‘Yes s Paulson, of course we remember you. Happy Thanksgiving, I hope  \\nyou are making a big turkey in our WA100 model oven,’ Vroom said, reading  \\nfrom a script that reminded us about the American festival of the day.\\nI could not hear the customer’s side of the conversation, but Ms Paulson  \\nwas obviously explaining her problem with the oven.\\n‘No Ms Paulson, you shouldn’t have unscrewed the cover,’ Vroom said,  \\nas politely as possible. \\n‘No, really madam. An electrical appliance like the WA100 should only  \\nhe serviced by trained professionals,’ Vroom said, reading verbatim from the  \\nWA100 service manual.\\nMs Paulson spoke for another minute. Our strategic bay hardly had a  \\nreputation for efficiency, but long calls like these could screw up Vroom’s  \\nresponse times.\\n‘See madam, you need to explain to me why you opened the top cover.  \\nThen perhaps we’ll understand why you got an electric shock… so tell me…  \\nyes…  oh  really?  Vroom  continued,  taking  deep  breaths.  Patience,  key  to  \\nbecoming a star agent, did not come naturally to him.\\nI looked around; people were busy with calls. Radhika helped someone  \\ndefrost  her  fridge;  Esha  assisted  a  customer  in  unpacking  a  dishwasher.  \\nEveryone was speaking with an American accent and sounded different from  \\nhow they had in the Qualis. I took a break from the calls to compile the call  \\nstatistic of thee previous day. I did not particularly like doing this, but Bakshi  \\nhad left me with little choice. \\n‘See  madam,’  Vroom  was  still  with  Ms  Paulson,  ‘I  understand  your  \\nturkey did not fit and you did not want to cut it, but you should not have  \\nopened up the equipment…. But see that is not the equipment’s fault… I can’t  \\nreally tell you what to do… I understand your son is coming, madam…. Now If  \\nyou had the WA150, that is a bigger size… ‘Vroom said, beginning to breathe  \\nfaster.\\nMs Paulson ranted on for a while longer.‘Ms Paulson, I suggest you take the oven to your dealer as soon as  \\npossible’ Vroom said firmly. ‘And next time, get a smaller turkey... and yes, a  \\nreadymade turkey will be a good idea for tonight… No, I don’t have a dial-a-\\nturkey number. Thank you for calling Ms Paulson, bye.’ Vroom ended the call.\\nVroom nagged his fist on the table.\\n‘Everything okay?’ I said, not looking up from my papers. \\n‘Yeah. Just a psycho customer,’ he mumbled as another number started  \\nflashing on his screen.\\nI worked on my computer for the next ten minutes, compiling the call  \\nstatistics of the previous day. Bakshi had also assigned me the responsibility  \\nof checking the other agent’s etiquette. Every now and then, I would listen in  \\non somebody’s call. At 10:47 p.m., I connected to Esha’s line.\\n‘Yes sir. I sound like your daughter? Oh, thank you. So what is wrong  \\nwith the vacuum cleaner/’ she was saying.\\n‘Your voice is so soothing,’ the caller said.\\n‘Thanks you sir. So, the vacuum cleaner…?’\\nEsha’s tone was perfect—just the right mix of politeness and firmness.  \\nManagement monitored us on average call handling times, or AHTs. As WASG  \\ngot the more painful customers, our AHT Benchmarks were higher at two-and-\\na-half minutes per call. I checked my files for everyone’s AHT—all of us were  \\nwithin targets.\\n‘Beep! The sound of the fax machine made me look up from my papers.  \\nI wondered who could be faxing us at this time. I went to the machine and  \\nchecked the incoming fax. It was from Bakshi.\\nThe fax machine took three minutes to churn out the seven pages he  \\nhad sent. I tore the message sheet off the machine and held the first sheet  \\nup.\\nFrom: Subhash Bakshi\\nSubject: Training Initiatives\\nDear Shyam,\\nJust FYI, I have recommended your name to assist in accent  \\ntraining as they are short of teachers. I am sure you can  \\nspare some time for this. As always, I am trying to get you  \\nmore relevant and strategic exposure.\\nYours,\\nSubhash Bakshi \\nManager, Connexions \\nI gasped as I read the rest of the fax. Bakshi was sucking me into several  \\nhours outside my shift to reach new recruits. Apart from the extra work, I  \\nhate accent is so confusing. You might think the Americans and their language  \\nare straightforward. Far from it—with them, each letter can be pronounced  \\nseveral different ways.I will give you just one example— T. With this letter Americans have  \\nfour different sounds. T can be silent so ‘internet’ becomes ‘ innernet’ and \\n‘advantage’ becomes ‘advannage’. The second way is when T and N merge\\n—‘written’ becomes ‘writn’ and ‘certain’ is ‘certn’. The third sound is when T  \\nis in the middle. There, it sounds like a D—‘ daughter’ is ‘daughter’ and \\n‘water’ in ‘wauder’. The last category, if you still care, is when Americans say  \\nT actually like a T. This happens when T is the beginning of the word like  \\n‘table’ or ‘stumble’. Man, it drivers me nuts. And this is just one consonant.  \\nThe vowels are another, more painful story. \\n‘What’s up/’ Vroom said, coming up to me.\\nI passed the fax to Vroom. He read it and smirked.\\n‘Yeah right. He sent you an FYI. Do you know what an FYI is?’ Vroom  \\nsaid.\\n‘What/’\\n‘Fuck  you  Instead.  It  is  a  standard  way  to  dump  responsibility  on  \\nsomeone else.’\\n‘I hate accent training man. You can’t teach Delhi people to speak like  \\nAmerican in a week.’\\n‘Just as you can’t train Americans to speak with a Punjabi accent,’  \\nVroom said and chuckled. ‘Anyway, go train-train, lose your brain.’\\n‘What will I do?’ I said, beginning to walk back towards our desk.\\n‘Go train-train, lose your brain,’ Vroom said and laughed. He liked the  \\nrhyme, and repeated it several times as we walked back to the bay.\\nI was back at my seat, Vroom’s words—‘train, train’—echoing in my  \\nhead. They were making me remember another kind of train altogether. It  \\nbrought back memories of the Rail Museum—where I had a date with Priyanka  \\na year ago.#5\\nMy Past Dates with \\nPriyanka—I\\nRail Museum, Chanakyapuri \\nOne year before this night\\nShe came thirty minutes late. I had seen the whole museum twice,  \\nexamined every little train model, stepped inside India’s oldest coal engine,  \\nunderstood the modern interactive siren system. I went to the canteen, which  \\nwas on an island  inn the  middle  of an  artificial  pond.  It was impressive  \\nlandscaping for museum. I though of lighting a cigarette, but I caught sight of  \\nthe  sign:  ‘Only  Steam  Engines  are  Allowed  to  Smoke.’  I  was  cradling  a  \\nlukewarm Coke in the museum canteen when she arrived.\\n‘Okay. Don’t say anything. Sorry, I’m late, I know, I know,’ she said and  \\nsat down with a thump in front of me. \\nI didn’t say anything. I looked at her tiny nose. I wondered ho it allowed  \\nin enough oxygen.\\n‘What, say something,’ she said after five seconds.\\n‘I thought you told me to be quiet,’ I said.\\n‘My mother needs professional help,’ Priyanka said. ‘She really does.’\\n‘What happened/’ I swirled the straw in my coke, making little fizzy  \\ndrops implode. \\n‘I’ll tell you. First, how do you like this place/ cute, isn’t it?’\\n‘The Rail Museum?’ I said, throwing my hands in the air. ‘How old are  \\nwe, twelve? Anyway, what happened with mom? What was the fuel today?\\n‘We don’t need fuel, just a spark is enough. Just as I was ready to leave  \\nto come here, she made a comment on my dress.’\\n‘What did she say?’ I asked, looking at her clothes. She wore a blue tie-\\nand-dye skirt, and a T-shirt that had a peace sign on it. It was typical Priyanka  \\nstuff. She wore earring with blue beads, which matched her necklace. She  \\nhad a hint of kohl in her eyes, which I was crazy about. \\n‘I was almost at the door and then she says, why don’t you wear the  \\ngold necklace I gave you for you your last birthday?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘And then/’ she obviously wasn’t wearing any gold necklace, as my gaze  \\nturned to the hollow of her neck, which I felt like touching. \\n‘And I was like, no mom, it won’t go with my dress. Yellow metal is  \\ntotally uncool, only aunties wear it. Boom, next thing we are having this big,  \\nlong argument. That’s what made me late. Sorry,’ she said.\\n‘You didn’t have to fight. Just wear the chain in front of her and  \\nremove it later,’ I said as the waiter came to take our order.‘but that’s not the point. Anyways,’ she said and turned tot eh waiter,  \\nget me a plate of samosas, I’m starving. Actually wait, that is so fattening, do  \\nyou have a salad?’\\nThe waiter gave us a blank look.\\n‘Where do you think you are?’ I said. ‘this is the Rail Museum canteen,  \\nnot an Italian bistro. You get what you see.’ \\n‘Okay, okay,’ she said, eyeing the stalls. ‘Get me the potato chips. No,  \\nget me the popcorn. Popcorn is lighter right? She looked at the waiter as if he  \\nwas a nutritionist.\\n‘Just get the popcorn,’ I said to the waiter.\\n‘So, what else is happening? Met Vroom?’ she said \\n‘;Was supposed to, but couldn’t. he had a date.’\\n‘With who? New girl?’\\n‘Of course. He never sticks to one. I wonder what girls see in him. All  \\nhot ones too,’ I said.\\n‘I can’t understand the deal with Vroom. He is the most materialistic  \\nand unemotional person I have met in my entire life,’ Priyanka said as the  \\npopcorn arrived at our table.\\n‘No he isn’t,’ I said grabbing more popcorn than I could hold.\\n‘Well, look at him—jeans, phones, pizzas and bikes. That is all he lives  \\nfor. And this whole new girlfriend every three months, c’mon, at some point  \\nyou’ve got to stop that, right?’\\n‘Well,  I’m happy  to  stick  to  the  one  I  have,’  I  said,  my  mouth  \\noverflowing with popcorn.\\n‘You are so cute,’ Priyanka said, as she blushed and smiled. She took  \\nsome more popcorn and stuffed it into my mouth.\\n‘Thanks,’ I said as I munched the popcorn. ‘Vroom has changed. He  \\nwasn’t like this when he first joined from his previous job.’\\n‘The one at the newspaper?’\\n‘Yeah, journalist trainee. He started in current affairs. Do you know  \\nwhat one of his famous pieces was called?’\\n‘No, what? Oh crap,’ Priyanka said, looking at someone behind me.\\n‘What happened?’\\n‘Nothing, just don’t look back. Some relatives of mine with their painful  \\nkids are here. Oh no,’ she said, looking down at our table.\\nNow when someone tells you not to look at something, you always feel  \\nan incredible urge to do just that. From the corner of my eye I saw a family  \\nwith two kids at the corner of the room.\\n‘Who else do you expect to come here but kids?’ I said. ‘Anyway, they  \\nare quite far.’\\n‘Shut up and look down. Anyway, tell me about Vroom’s piece,’ she  \\nsaid.\\n‘Oh yeah. It was called ‘ Why Don’t politicians Ever Commit Suicide ?”’\\n‘What? Sounds morbid.’‘Well,  the  article  said  all  kinds  of  people-students,  housewives,  \\nbusinessmen, employees and even film stars—commit suicide. But politicians  \\nnever do. That tells you something.’\\n‘What?’ she  said, still keeping her eyes down.\\n‘Well, Vroom’s point was that suicide is a horrible thing and people do it  \\nonly  because  they  are  really  hurt.  This  means  they  feel  something.  But  \\npoliticians don’t. So, basically, this country is run by people who don’t feel  \\nanything.’\\n‘Wow! Can’t imagine that going down well with his editor.’ \\n‘You bet it didn’t. However, Vroom had sneaked it in. the editor only  \\nsaw it after it was printed and all hell broke loose. Vroom somehow saved his  \\njob, but his bosses moved him to Page 3.’\\n‘Our Vroom? Page 3?’\\n‘They told Vroom he was good looking, so he would fit in there. In  \\naddiction, he had done a photography course. He could click the pictures  \\nhimself.’\\n‘Cover Page 3 because you are good looking? Now that sounds dumb,’  \\nshe said.\\n‘It is dumb. But Vroom look his revenge there too. He took unflattering  \\npictures of the glitterati—faces stuffed with food, close-ups of cellulite thighs,  \\ndrunk people throwing up—that sort of stuff showed up in papers the next  \\nday.’\\n‘Oh my God,’ Priyanka laughed. ‘He sounds like an activist. I can’t  \\nunderstand his switching to the call center for money.’\\n‘Well, according to him, there is activism in chasing money too.’ \\n‘And how does that work?’\\n‘Well, his point is that the only reason Americans have say in this world  \\nis because they have cash. The day we get money, we can screw them. So the  \\nfirst thing we have to do is get the money.’\\n‘Interesting,’ Priyanka said and let out a sigh. ‘Well, that is why we slog  \\nat night. I could have done my B.Ed right after college. But I wanted to save  \\nsome money first. Can’t open my dream nursery school without cash. So until  \\nthen, it is two hundred calls a night, night after night.’ Priyanka rested her  \\nchin on her elbows. I looked at her. I think she would make the cutest nursery  \\nschool principal ever.\\n‘Western Appliances, Sam speaking, how may I help you? Please let me  \\nhelp you? Please…’ I said, imitating an American accent.\\nPriyanka laughed again.\\n‘Priyanka dideeee,’ a five-year old boy’s voice started customers from  \\ntheir samosas.\\nThe boy running towards Priyanka had a model train set and a glass of  \\nfountain  coke  precariously  balanced  in  his  hands.  He  ran  without  co-\\nordination: the excitement  of seeing  his  didi  was  too much  for  him.  He  \\ntripped near our table and I lunged to save him. I succeeded, but his fountain  \\ncoke fell all over my shirt.‘Oh no,’ I said eve as I saw another three-year-old girl with a huge  \\nlollipop in her mouth running towards us. I moved aside from the tornado to  \\nsave another collision. She landed straight on Priyanka’s lap. I went to the  \\nrestroom to clean my shirt.\\n‘Shyam,’ Priyanka said when I returned, ‘meet my cousin, Dr Anurag.’  \\nThe  entire  family  had  shifted  to  our  table.  Priyanka  introduced  me  to  \\neveryone. I forgot their names as soon as I heard them. Priyanka told her  \\ndoctor cousin I worked at a call center. I think the cousin was less interested  \\nin talking to me after that. The kids had eaten half the popcorn and spilt the  \\nrest of it. The boy was running his model train set through popcorn fields on  \\nthe table and screaming a mock siren with his sister.\\n‘Sit, Shyam,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘No, actually I have an early shift today,’ I said and got up to leave.\\n‘But wait…’ Priyanka said.\\n‘No, I have to go,’ I said and ran out of the Rail Museum, which had  \\nturned as chaotic as a railway station.#6\\n‘Ouch, Esha scream in the middle of her call broke my train of though  \\nand memories.\\n‘What?’ I said.\\n‘I heard loud static. Really bad line… hello, yes madam, Esha said.\\nRadhika was knitting something with pink wool while she waited for a  \\ncall. People were busy, but I could sense that the call volume was lower than  \\nusual tonight.\\n‘Eew,’ Priyanka said five seconds later.\\n‘Freaking hell,’ Vroom said as he pulled off his headset from his ears.\\n‘What’s going on?’ I said.\\n‘There’s shrill static coming every few seconds now. Ask Bakshi to send  \\nsomeone,’ Vroom said, rubbing his ear.\\n‘I’ll go to his office. You guys cover the calls,’ I said and looked at the  \\ntime. It was 10:51 p.m. The first break was in less than an hour.\\nI passed by the training room on my way to Bakshi’s office. I perked  \\ninside: fresh trainees were attending a session. Some students were snoozing;  \\nthey were probably still getting used to working at night.\\n‘35=10’, the instructor wrote in big bold letters on the blackboard.\\nI remembered the 35=10 rule from my training days two years ago. It  \\nhelped agents adjust to their callers.\\n‘Remember,’  the  instructor  said  to  the  class,  ‘a  thirty-five-year-old  \\nAmerican’s brain and IQ is the same as a ten-years-old Indian’s brain. This will  \\nhelp you understand your clients. You need to be as patient as you are when  \\ndealing with a child. Americans are dumb, just accept it. I don’t want anyone  \\nlosing their cool during the calls…’\\nI dreaded the day when I would have to teach in such classes. My own  \\nDelhi accent was impossible to get rid of, and I must have come last in my  \\naccent class.\\n‘I have to get out of this,’ I said to myself as I went to Bakshi’s cabin.\\nBakshi was in his oversized office, starting at his computer with his  \\nmouth open. As I cam in, he rapidly closed the windows. He was probably  \\nsurfing the Internet for bikini babes or something.\\n‘Good evening sir,’ I said.\\n‘Oh hello, Sam… please come in.’ Bakshi liked to call us by our Western  \\nnames. I hated it.\\nI walked into his office slowly, to give him time to close his favorite  \\nwebsites.\\n‘Come,  come  Sam,  don’t  worry.  I  believe  in  being  an  open  door  \\nmanager.’ Bakshi said.\\nI looked at his big square face, unusually large for his 5’6” body. The  \\noversized face resembled the Ravan cut-out at Dusshera. His face shone as  \\nusual. It was the first thing you noticed about Bakshi—the oilfields on his face.  I think if you could recreate Bakshi’s skin as our landscape, you could solve  \\nIndia’s oil problem. Priyanka told me one that when she met Bakshi for the  \\nfirst time, she had an overwhelming urge to take a tissue and wipe it hard  \\nacross his face. I do not think one tissue would be enough though.\\nBakshi was around thirty but looked forty and spoke like he was fifty.  \\nHe had worked in Connexions for the past three years. Before that, he did an  \\nMBA from some unpronounceable university in South India. He though he was  \\nMichael Porter or something (Porter is this big management guru—I didn’t  \\nknow either, but Bakshi told me in an FYI once) and loved to talk in manager’s  \\nlanguages or Managese, which is another languages like English and American.\\n‘So, how are the resources doing?’ Bakshi said, swiveling on his chair.  \\nHe never refers to us a people; we are all ‘resources.’\\n‘Fine, sir. I actually to talk about a problem. The phone lines are not  \\nwalking property—lots of static coming in the calls. Can you ask systems…’\\n‘Fine, sir. I actually wanted to talk about a problem. The phone lines  \\nare  not  working  propely—lots  of  static  coming  in  the  calls.  Can  you  ask  \\nsystems…’\\n‘Sam,’ Bakshi said, pointing a pen at me.\\n‘Yes?’\\n‘What did I tell you?’\\n‘About what?’\\n‘About how to approach problems.’\\n‘What?’\\n‘Think.’\\nI though hard, but nothing came to mind.\\nI don’t remember sir…. Solve them?’\\n‘No. I said big pictures. Always start at the big picture.’\\nI was puzzled. What was the big picture her e? There was static coming  \\nthrough on the phones and we had to ask systems to fix it. I could have called  \\nthem myself, but Bakshi’s intervention would get a faster response.\\n‘Sir, it is a specific issue. Customers are hearing disturbance…’\\n‘Sam,’ Bakshi sighed and signaled me to sit down, ‘what makes a good  \\nmanager?’\\n‘What?’ I sat down in front of him and surreptitiously looked at my  \\nwatch. It was 10:57 p.m. I hoped the call flow was moderate so the others  \\nwouldn’t have a tough time with one less person on the desk.\\n‘Wait,’ Bakshi said and took out a writing pad and pen. He placed the  \\npad on the middle of the table and then drew a graph that looked like this:He finished the graph and turned the notebook hundred and eighty  \\ndegrees to make it face me. He clicked his pen shut with a swagger, as proud  \\nas da Vinci finishing the Mona Lisa.\\n‘Sir, systems?’ I said, after staying silent for a few seconds. \\n‘Wait, first you tell me. What is this?’ Bakshi said and taped his index finger  \\non the diagram.\\nI tried to make sense of the chart and possibly connection to the static  \\non the phone lines. I couldn’t get it.\\nI shook my head in defeat.\\n‘Tch-tch, see let me tell you,’ Bakshi said. ‘This chart is your career. If  \\nyou want to be more senior, you have to move up this curve.’ He put a finger  \\non the curve and traced it, guiding me on how I should look at my life.\\n‘Yes sir’ I said having nothing better to say.\\n‘And do you know how to do that/’\\nI shook my head. Vroom probably though I was out smoking. I did feel  \\nsome smoke coming out of my ears.\\n‘Big Picture. I just told you focus on the big picture. Learn to identify  \\nthe strategic variables, Sam.’\\nBefore I could speak, he had pulled out his pen again and was drawing  \\nanother diagram.\\n‘Maybe I can explain this to you with the help of a 2x2 matrix,’ Bakshi  \\nsaid and bent down to wrote ‘High and ‘Low’ along the boxes. I had to stop  \\nhim.\\n‘Sir please,’ I said, placing both my hands down to cover the sheet.\\n‘What?’ he said with irritation, as if Einstein had been disturbed at  \\nwork.\\n‘Sir, this is really interesting to me. I must come back and learn this. But  \\nright now any team is waiting and my shift is in progress.’\\n‘So?’ Bakshi said.\\n‘The phones, sir. Please tell systems they should check the WASG bay  \\nurgently,’ I said, without pausing to breathe.\\n‘Huh?’ Bakshi said, surprised at how fast I speaking.\\n‘Just call systems sir,’ I said and stood up, ‘using that.’ I pointed at his  \\ntelephone and rushed back to my bay.#7\\n‘Nice break eh?’ Vroom said when I returned to our bay ‘C’mon man,  \\njust went to Bakshi’s office about the static,’ I said.\\n“Is he sending someone?’ Vroom asked as he untangled his phone wires.\\n‘He said I should identify the strategic variable first,’ I said and sat down  \\non my seat. I rested my face on my hands.\\n‘Strategic variables? What’s that?’ Vroom said, without looking at me.\\n‘How the hell do I know?’ I snorted. ‘If I did, I would be team leader. He also  \\nmade some diagrams’\\nRadhika, Esha and Priyanka were busy on calls. Every few seconds, they  \\nwould turn the phone away from their ears to avoid the loud static. I wished  \\nthe systems guy would come by soon.\\n‘What diagram?’ Vroom said, as he took out some chewing gum from his  \\ndrawer. He offered one to me.\\n‘Some crap 2x2 matrix or something,’ I said, declining Vroom’s offer.\\n‘Poor Bakshi, he is just a little silly but a harmless creature. Don’t worry  \\nabout him,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Where the hell is the systems guy?’ I picked up the telephone and  \\nspoke to the systems department. They had not yet received a call from  \\nBakshi. ‘Can you please come fast…yes, we have an emergency…yes, our  \\nmanager knows about it.’\\n‘I can’t believe Bakshi hasn’t called them yet,’ I said, after I had got the  \\nsystems guys to promise they’d send someone right away.\\n‘Things are bad around here, my friend,’ Vroom said. ‘Bad news may be  \\ncoming.’\\n‘What do you mean? Are they cutting jobs?’ I asked, now a little worried  \\nand anxious, along with being frustrated. It’s amazing how all these nasty  \\nemotions decide to visit me together.\\n‘I’m trying to find out,’ Vroom said, clinking open a window on his  \\nscreen. ‘The Western Computers account is really suffering. If we lose that  \\naccount, the call center will sink.’\\n‘Crap. I heard something about it from Shefali. I think the website we  \\nmade was too useful. People have stopped calling us,’ I said.\\nA visitor in our bay interrupted our conversation. I knew he was the  \\nsystems guy, as he had three pages on his belt and two memory cards around  \\nhis neck.\\nPriyanka told him about the problem and made him listen to the static.\\nThe systems guy asked us to disconnect our lines for ten minutes.\\nEveryone removed their headsets. I saw Esha adjusting her hair. She  \\ndoes it at least ten times a night. First she will remove the rubber band that’s  \\ntying up her hair and her hair will come loose. Then, she assembles it all  \\ntogether and ties it back again.\\nHer hair was light-colored and intensely curly towards the ends: the  \\nresult of an expensive hair styling job, which cost as much as a minor surgery.  It didn’t even look that nice if you ask me. Naturally curly hair is one thing,  \\nbut processed curly hair looks like tangled telephone wires.\\nI saw Vroom stare at Esha. It is never easy for guys to work with a hot  \\ngirl in office. I mean, what are you supposed to do? Ignore their sexiness and  \\nstare at your computer? Sorry, somehow I don’t think men were designed to  \\ndo that.\\nRadhika  took  her  pink  wool  out  from  her  bag  and  started  to  knot  \\nfrantically Military Uncle’s system was still working and somehow glued to his  \\nmonitor.\\n‘What are you knitting?’ Esha turned to Radhika.\\n‘A scarf for my mother-in-law. Damn sweet she is, feels cold at night,’  \\nRadhika said.\\n‘She is not sweet—‘ Vroom began to say but Radhika interrupted him.\\n‘Shh Vroom. She is fine, just traditional.’\\n‘And that sucks, right? Vroom said.\\n‘Not at all. In fact, I like the cozy family feeling. They are only a little  \\nbit old-fashioned,’ Radhika said and smiled. I did not think the smile was  \\ngenuine, but it was none of my business.\\n‘Yeah right. Only a little. As in always cover your head with your sari  \\ntypes,’ Vroom said.\\n‘They make you cover your head?’ Esha asked, speaking through teeth  \\nclenched around her rubber band.\\n‘They don’t  make me do anything, Esha. I am willing to follow their  \\nculture. All married women in their house do it,’ Radhika said.\\n‘Still it is a bit weird,’ Esha said.\\n‘Anyway, I tool it as a challenge. I love Anuj and he said he came as a  \\npackage. But yeah, sometimes I miss wearing low waist jeans like you wore  \\nthe day before.’\\nI was amazed Radhika remembered what Esha wore the day before.  \\nOnly women have this special area in the brain that keeps track of everything  \\nthey and their friends wore the last fifty times.\\n‘You think those jeans?’ Esha said, her eyes lighting up.\\n‘I love them. But I guess you need the right figure for them,’ Radhika  \\nsaid.  ‘Anyways,  sorry  to  change  the  topic  guys,  but  we’re  forgetting  \\nsomething here.’\\n‘What? The systems?’ I asked, as I looked under the table. The systems  \\nguy  lurked  within,  in  a  jungle  wires.  He  told  me  would  need  ten  more  \\nminutes.\\nI checked my watch. I was 11:20 p.m. I wondered if Bakshi would be  \\ncoming for his daily rounds soon.\\n‘Not  the  static,’  Radhika  said  as  she  kept  her  knitting  aside.  ‘Miss  \\nPriyanka has some big news for us, remember?’\\n‘Oh yes. C’mon Priyanka tell us,’ Esha screamed. Military Uncle looked  \\nup from his screen for a second, and then went back to work. I wondered if  \\nhe’d been this quiet when he lived with his son and daughter-in-law.‘Okay I do have something to tell you,’ Priyanka said with a sheepish  \\ngrin, making her two dimples more prominent. She brought out a box of  \\nsweets from her large plastic bag.\\n‘Whatever your news is, we do get to eat the sweets, right? Vroom  \\nwanted to know.\\n‘Of  course,’  Priyanka  said,  carefully  opening  the  red  cellophane  \\nwrapping on the box. I hate it when she is so methodical. Just trip the damn  \\nwrapping off, I thought. Anyway, it was not my business. I looked under the  \\ntable for a few seconds, as if to help the systems guy. Of Course, my ears  \\nwere focused on Priyanka’s every word.\\n‘So, what’s up? Oh milk cake, my favourite,’ Radhika said, even as  \\nVroom jumped to grab the first piece.\\n‘I’ll tell you, but you guys have to swear it won’t leave WASG,’ Priyanka  \\nsaid. She offered the box to Radhika and Esha. Radhika took two pieces, while  \\nEsha broke the tiniest piece possible with human fingers. I guess the low-cut  \\njeans figure comes at a price.\\n‘Of course we won’t tell anyone. I hardly have any friends outside the  \\nWASG. Now tell please,’ Esha said and wiped her long fingers with a tissue.\\n‘Well, let’s just say, my mom is the happier person on earth today,’  \\nPriyanka said.\\n‘No riddles man. Just tell and the story,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Well, you know my mom and her obsession for an NRI match for her  \\nrebellious daughter.’\\n‘Uh-uh, Radhika nodded as she ate her milk cake.\\n‘So these family friends of ours brought a proposal for me. It came from  \\none of their relatives in Seattle. I would have said no like always. However,  \\nthis time, I saw the pictures, which were cute. I spoke to the guy on the  \\nphone—he  sounded  decent.  He  works  in  Microsoft—so  is  doing  well.  His  \\nparents are in Delhi and I met them today. Nice people,’ Priyanka said and  \\npaused to break a piece for herself. She could have broken a smaller piece, I  \\nthought, but it was not really my business.\\n‘And,’ Esha said, her eyes opened wide and starting at Priyanka.\\n‘I don’t know, just something clicked or what,’ Priyanka said, playing  \\nwith her milk cake rather than eating it. ‘They asked for my decision upfront  \\nand I said—yes.’\\n‘Waaaoooow!  Oh  wow!’  the  girls  screamed  at  their  highest  pitch  \\npossible.  The  system  guy  shook  in  terror  under  the  table.  I  told  him  \\neverything was fine and asked him to continue. At least everything was fine  \\noutside. Inside, I had a burning feeling, like someone had tossed a hot coal in  \\nmy stomach.\\nRadhika and Esha got up to hug Priyanka as if India had won the World  \\nCup or something. People get married everyday. Did these girls really have to  \\ncreate a scene? I wished the phones would start working again so I did not  \\nhave to listen to his nonsense.\\nI looked at my computer screen and saw that Microsoft Word was open.  \\nAngrily I closed all windows with the Microsoft logo on it.‘Congratulations, Priyanka,’ Vroom said, ‘that’s big news.’\\nEven Military Uncle got up and came to shake hands with Priyanka.  \\nGrown ups like it when young people decide to get married. Of course, he was  \\nback at his desk in twenty seconds.\\n‘This deserves more than milk cake. Where is our treat?’ Esha asked.  \\nGirls like Esha hardly eat anything, but still jump around asking for treats.\\n‘Treat  will  come  guys,’  Priyanka  said,  her  smile  taking  permanent  \\nresidence on her face. ‘I have only said yes. No ceremonies have happened  \\nyet.’\\n‘You’ve met the guy?’ Vroom said.\\n‘No, he’s in Seattle. But we spoke for hours on the phone. And I have  \\nseen his picture. He is cute. Want to see the photo?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘No thanks,’ I blurted out in reflex. Damn, I could not believe I’d said  \\nthat by sheer luck, I had not said it loud enough for Priyanka to hear.\\n‘Huh? You said something?’ Priyanka asked, looking at me.\\nI shook my head and pointed under the table. Yes, my only focus was to  \\nfix the phones.\\n‘Do you want some milk cake?’ Priyanka asked and shunted the box  \\ntowards me.\\n‘No, thanks,’ I said and slid the box back.\\n‘I thought milk cake was your favorite.’\\n‘Not anymore. My tastes have changed,’ I said. ‘And I’m trying to cut  \\ndown.’\\n‘Not eve n a small piece?’ she asked and titled her head. At some stage  \\nof my life, I sued to find that head-tilt cute, but today I remained adamant.\\nI shook my head. Our eyes locked. When you have shared a relationship  \\nwith someone, the first change is in how you look into each other’s eyes. The  \\ngaze becomes more fixed, and it is hard to pull away from it.\\n‘Aren’t you going to say anything?’ Priyanka said. When girls say that,  \\nit’s not really a question. It means they want you to say something.\\n‘About what? The phone lines? They’ll be fixed in ten minutes,’ I said.\\n‘Not that. I’m getting married, Shyam.’\\n‘Oh really,’ I said, as if this were first time I had heard the news.\\n‘I just said yes to a proposal today,’ she said.\\n‘Good,’ I said and turned to my screen.\\n‘Show us the picture!’ Esha screamed, as if Priyanka was going to show  \\nher Brad Pitt naked or something. Priyanka took out a photograph from her  \\nhandbag and passed it around. I saw it from a distance: he looked like a  \\nregular software geek, similar to the guy under our table, but with better  \\nclothes. He stood straight with his stomach pulled in—an old trick any guy with  \\na paunch applies when he gets his picture clicked. He wore glasses, and had a  \\nsuper neat hairstyle as if his mom clutched his cheeks and combed his hair  \\nevery morning. Actually, she just might have for this ‘arranged marriage’  \\npicture.  He  was  standing  with  the  statue  of  Liberty  in  the  background,  \\nperhaps to emphasize that he was an NRI match and this better than others.  \\nHis forced smile made him look like a total loser if you ask me—like the kind  of guy who never spoke to a girl in college. However, now he was hot, and  \\ngirls with dimples were ready to marry him without even meeting him.\\n‘He’s so cute. Like a little teddy bear,’ Esha said and passed the picture  \\nto Radhika.\\nWhen girls call a guy ‘teddy bear’, they just mean he is nice but they  \\nwill never be attracted to him. Girls may say they like such guys, but teddy  \\nbears never get to sleep with anyone. Unless of course their moms hunt the  \\nneighborhood for them.\\n‘Are you okay?’ Priyanka said to me. The others were busy analyzing  \\nthe picture.\\n‘Yeah. Why?’\\n‘No. just expected a little more reaction. We’ve known each other for  \\nfour years, more than anybody else on the desk.’\\nRadhika, Esha and Vroom turned their hands away from the picture to  \\nlook at us.\\n‘Reaction?’ I said. ‘I’m thought I said good.’\\n‘That’s all?’ Priyanka said. Her smile had left the building.\\n‘What?’ I said. ‘I’m busy trying to get the system fixed.’\\nEveryone continued to stare at me.\\n‘Okay,’ I said, ‘okay, Priyanka. This is  great news. I am  so happy for \\nyou. Okay?’\\n‘You could have used a better tone,’ Priyanka said. ‘Anyway, I’ll just  \\ncome back,’ she mumbled, and walked away quickly towards the ladies room.\\n‘What? Why is everyone staring at me?’ I said and everyone turned  \\naway.\\nThe systems gut finally came our from under the table.\\n‘Fixed?’ I said.\\n‘I  need  signal  testing  equipment,’  he  said,  wiping  sweat  off  his  \\nforehead.  ‘The  problem  could  be  outside.  Builders  are  digging  all  over  \\nGurgaon right now, some stupid contractor may have dug over our lines. Just  \\ntake a break while I come back. Call your manager here as well,’ he said and  \\nleft.\\nI picked up the telephone to call Bakshi. The line was busy. I left a voice  \\nmail for him to come to the desk.\\nPriyanka returned from the restroom. I noticed she had washed her  \\nface. Her nose still has a drop of water on top of it.\\n‘Sounds like an easy night. I hope it never gets fixed,’ Radhika said,  \\nknotting ferociously.\\n‘Nothing better than a call center job if the phones are not working,’  \\nPriyanka said and closed the box of sweets.\\n‘So tell us more, what is he like?’ Esha said.\\n‘Who? Ganesh?’ Priyanka asked.\\n‘His  name  is  Ganesh?  Nice,’  Esha  said  and  switched  on  her  mobile  \\nphone. Everyone else followed suit and several opening tones filled the room.  \\nNormally agents could not use cell phones in the bay, but it was okay to do so  \\nnow as the system was down.I had two text messages from Shefali: One wishing me goodnight, and  \\nanother one wishing me sweet dreams and a cuddly night. I cringed.\\n‘Does Ganesh like to talk? Sometimes the software types are real quite,’  \\nRadhika said.\\n‘Oh yes, he talks a lot. In fact, I might get a cal from him now because  \\nmy phone is on,’ Priyanka said and smiled. ‘We’re still getting to know each  \\nother, so any communications good.’\\n‘You sound sooo happy,’ Esha said. Her ‘so’ lasted four seconds.\\n‘I  am happy. I can see what Radhika says now about getting a new  \\nfamily. Ganesh’s mom came home today and gave me a big gold chain. And  \\nshe was all hugging me and kissing me.’\\n‘Sounds gross,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Shut up, Vroom,’ Esha said. ‘Oh Priyanka, you’re so lucky.’ \\nVroom  sensed  that  I  was  not  exactly  jumping  with  joy  at  the  \\nconversation.\\n‘Cigarette?’ he said.\\nI looked at my watch. It was 11:30, our usual time for taking a smoke. In  \\nany case, I preferred burning my lungs to sticking around to find out Ganesh’s  \\nhobbies.\\n #8\\nVroom and I went to the call center parking lot Vroom leaned against his  \\nbike and lit two cigarettes with one matchstick. I looked at his tall and thin  \\nframe. If he weren’t so skinny, you’d say he was a stud. Still, a cigarette  \\nlooked out of place on his boyish face. Perhaps conscious of the people who  \\nhad called him Baby Face before, he always kept a one-day old stubble. He  \\npassed an already burning cigarette to me. I took a puff and let it out in the  \\ncold night air.\\nWe kept quiet for a minute and I was thankful to Vroom for that. One  \\nfinally thing guys do know is when to shut up.\\nVroom finally spoke, starting with a neutral topic. ‘I need a break man.  \\nGood thing I’m going to Manali next weekend.’\\n‘Cool, Manali is really nice,’ I said.\\n‘I’m going with my school buddies. We might ride up there on bikes.’\\n‘Bikes? Are you buts, you’ll freeze to death.’\\n‘Two words: leather jackets. Anyway, when did you go there?’\\n‘Last year. We took a bus though,’ I said.\\n‘Who all went?’ Vroom said as he looked for a place to flick ash. He  \\nfound none. He stepped to a corner of the parking lot and plucked two large  \\nleaves from a tree. We tapped our cigarette on the improvised ashtray.\\n‘Priyanka and I,’ I said and turned silent. Vroom did not respond either  \\nfor ten seconds.\\n‘Fun?’ he finally said.\\n‘Yeah, it was great. Apart from the aches from the bus ride,’ I said.\\n‘Why, what happened?’\\n‘We took a bus at four in the morning from ISBT. Priyanka was in her  \\nanti-snob phase, so she insisted we take the ordinary slow bus and not the  \\ndeluxe fast one. She also anted to enjoy the scenery slowly.’\\n‘And then?’\\nThen what? The moment the bus reached the highway, she learned on  \\nmy shoulder and slept off. My shoulder cramped and my body turned sore. But  \\napart from that horrible journey, it was great fun.’\\n‘She’s a silly girl,’ Vroom said. Letting out a big puff, his face smiling  \\nbehind the smoke ring.\\n‘She is. You should have seen her then. She used to wear all these  \\nbeads and FabIndia stuff all the time. And then she’d sit with the truck drivers  \\nand have tea.’\\n‘Wow. Can’t imagine Priyanka like that now,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Trust me, the girl has a wild side,’ I said and paused, as her face came  \\nto mind. ‘Anyway, it’s history now. Girls change.’\\n‘You bet. She’ll all set now.’\\nI nodded. I didn’t want to talk about Priyanka anymore. At least one  \\npart of me didn’t. The rest of my parts always wanted to talk about her.‘NRI  catch,  Microsoft  and  all.  Not  bad,’  Vroom  continued  as  he  lit  \\nanother cigarette. I narrowed my eyes at him.\\n‘What?’ he said. It’s in my daily quota. It is only my third of five.’ He  \\nexhaled a giant cloud.\\n‘It’s a little too quick, isn’t it?’ I said.\\n‘What? The cigarette? I need it today.’\\n‘Not theat. Priyanka’s wedding. Don’t you think she is deciding too  \\nfast?’\\n‘Fast? C’mon man, you don’t get matches like this everyday. He is in  \\nfreaking Microsoft. As good as they get. He is MS Groom 1.1—deluxe edition.’\\n‘What is the deal with Microsoft? Good job?’\\n‘Dude, I’m sure he packs close to a hundred grand a year.’\\n‘What is that? A hundred thousand US dollars a year?’\\nVroom nodded. I tried to convert hundred thousand US dollars to rupees  \\nand divide it by twelve to get the monthly salary. There were too many zeros  \\nand it was a tough calculation to do in my head. I racked my brain for a few  \\nseconds.\\n‘Stop calculating in rupees,’ Vroom said and smiled.\\n‘I’m not doing any calculations.’\\n‘Priyanka’s got a catch. I’m telling you,’ Vroom repeated.\\nHe paused and looked at me. His eyes were wet like a puppy’s brown  \\nand kind to look at. I could see why girls flocked to him. It was the eyes.\\n‘I’m going to ask you a question. Will you answer it honestly?’ Vroom  \\nsaid.\\n‘Sure.’\\n‘Are you upset she is getting married? I know you have feelings for her.’\\n‘No,’ I said and  stated  laughing. ‘I just find  it a bit strange. But I  \\nwouldn’t say I’m upset. That is too strong a word. It is not like we’re going  \\naround now or anything. No sir, I am not upset.’\\nVroom  waited  while  I  continued  to  laugh  exaggeratedly.  When  I’d  \\nstopped he said, ‘Okay, don’t bullshit me. What happened to your re-proposal  \\nplans?’\\nI remained silent.\\nIt’s okay man. You can tell me.’\\nI sighed, ‘Well, of course I feel for her. But they are just vestigial  \\nfeelings.’\\n‘Vesti what?’\\n‘Like vestigial organs. They serve no purpose or value. But they can give  \\nyou a pain in the appendix. Same with my feelings for Priyanka. I’m supposed  \\nto have moved on, but obviously it hasn’t happened. Meanwhile, MR NRI  \\ncomes and gives me a kick in the rear end,’ I said.\\n‘Talk to her. Don’t tell me you’re not going to,’ Vroom said and exhaled  \\ntwo smoke rings.\\n‘I was planning to real soon. I though we’d submit the website user  \\nmanual and hopefully that would have made it easier for Boston to approve  my promotion. How did I know there would be milk cake distribution tonight?  \\nHow was it by the way? I didn’t touch it.’\\n‘Milk cake was great. Never sulk when food is at stable dude. Anyways,  \\nscrew that. Listen, you still have some time. She has only said yes.’\\n‘I hope so. Though even as team leader, it’s hard to compete with Mr  \\nMicrosoft,’ I said.\\nWe remained silent for a few more seconds. Vroom spoke again.\\n‘Yeah man, Girls are strategic. They’ll take about love and romance and  \\nall, that crap—but when it comes to doing the deal, they will choose the  \\nfattest chicken,’ he said, and bunched up the leaf ashtray so it became like a  \\nbowl.\\n‘I guess I can only become fat, not a fat chicken,’ I said.\\n‘Yeah, you need to be far, fresh and fluffy. Girls know their stuff. That’s  \\nwhy  you  shouldn’t  feel  so  upset.  We  aren’t  good  husband  material—just  \\naccept it.’\\n‘Thanks Vroom, that really makes my day.’ I said. I did agree with  \\nVroom  though.  It  was  evolution.  Maybe  nature  wanted  dimple-cheeked,  \\nsoftware-geek, mini-Ganesh babies. They were of far more value to society  \\nthan depressed, good-for-nothing junior Shyams.\\n‘And anyway, it’s the girl who always gets to choose. Men propose and  \\nwomen accept the proposal or, as in many cases, reject it.’\\nIt’s true. Girls go around rejecting men like it is their birthright. They  \\nhave no idea how much it hurts us. I read once (or maybe saw it during one of  \\nmy Discovery Channel phases) that the reason for this is that the female of  \\nthe species has to beat their offspring with a lot of effort. Hence they choose  \\ntheir mates carefully. Meanwhile, men dance around, spend cash, make them  \\nlaugh, write stupid poems, anything to win them over. The only species where  \\ncourting works in reverse is the sea horse. Instead of the females, the male  \\nsea horse bears the offspring: they carry baby sea horse eggs in their pockets.  \\nGuess what? The female sea horses are always hitting on the males, while the  \\nlatter pucker their noses and get to pick the cutest female. I wished if I were  \\na sea horse. How hard can it be to carry a couple of eggs in a backpack?\\nVroom interrupted my thoughts.\\n‘But who knows. Priyanka isn’t like other girls, or maybe she is after all.  \\nEither way, don’t give up man. Try to get her back,’ Vroom said and patted  \\nmy shoulder in encouragement.\\n‘Speaking of back, shouldn’t we be heading back to the bay?’ I said and  \\nlooked at my watch, it’s 11:45 p.m.’\\nWe passed the Western Computers main bay as we returned from the  \\nparking  lot.  The  main  bay  sounded  like  a  noisy  school,  except  the  kids  \\nweren’t talking to each other, but to customers. Monitor problem, viruses,  \\nstrange error message—there was nothing  Connexions could  not help you  \\nwith.\\n‘Still looks busy,’ I said.‘Not at all. People have told me call traffic is down forty percent. I think  \\nthey’ll cut a lot of staff, or worst case scenario, cut all people and shift the  \\nclient to the Bangalore center.’\\n‘Bangalore? What will happen here?’ I said.\\nThey’ll close this poorly managed madhouse down. What else? That is  \\nwhat happens when people like Bakshi spend half their time playing politics  \\nwith other managers,’ Vroom said. He spotted a good looking girl in the  \\nWestern Computers bay and pointed her out to me.\\n ‘Close down!’ I said, after studying the pretty girl for half a second.  \\n‘Are you serious, what will happen to the hundreds of jobs here?’\\n‘Like they care. You think Bakshi cares?’ Vroom said and shrugged his  \\nlanky shoulders.\\n‘Crap  happens  in  life.  It  could  happen  tonight,’  Vroom  said  as  we  \\nreached the WASG.#9\\nThe systems guy was under the table again.\\n‘No calls yet. They’ve called for a senior engineer,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘It’s an external fault. Some cables are damaged I think. Gurgaon is  \\ngoing nuts with constructions,’ the systems guy said, as he emerged from  \\nunder the table.\\n‘Bakshi knows?’ I said.\\n‘I don’t know,’ Priyanka said.\\nVroom and I sat down at our desk.\\n‘It’s not too bad. Nice break,’ Esha said as she filed her nails with a  \\nweirdly shaped nail cutter.\\nPriyanka’s cell phone began to rung startling everyone.\\n‘Who is calling you so late?’ Radhika said, still knitting her scarf.’\\n‘Long distance I think,’ Priyanka said and smiled.\\n‘Oooh!’ Esha squealed, like a two-year-old on a bounce castle. What is  \\nthe big deal about a long distance phone call? I thought.\\n‘Hi Ganesh. I just switched my phone on,’ Priyanka said. ‘I can’t believe  \\nyou called so soon.’\\nI could not hear Ganesh’s response. Thank God.\\n‘Fifteen times? I can’t believe you tried my number fifteen times…so  \\nsorry,’ Priyanka said, looking idiotic with happiness.\\n‘Yes I’m at work. But it’s really chaotic today. Systems are down…  \\nHello?... How come you’re working on Thanksgiving? Oh, nice of the Indians to  \\noffer to work…hello? Priyanka said.\\n‘What happened?’ Esha said.\\n‘There’s hardly any network,’ Priyanka said, shaking her phone as if  \\nthat would improve the reception. I felt like shaking her.\\n‘We’re in the basement. Nothing comes into this black hole,’ Vroom  \\nsaid. He was surfing the internet, and was on the Formula I website.\\n‘Landline,’ Esha said, pointing to the spare phone on one desk. Every  \\nteam  in  Connexions  had  a  spare  independent  landline  at  their  desk  for  \\nemergency use. ‘Tell him to call on the landline.’\\n‘Here?’ Priyanka asked, looking to me for permission.\\nNormally this would be unthinkable, but our systems were down so it  \\ndid not really matter. Also, I did not want to look like a sore loser preventing  \\na new couple from starting their romance.\\nI nodded and pretended to be absorbed by my computer screen. As the  \\nad-hoc team leader, I had some powers. I could approve any personal calls. I  \\ncould also listen in on any line on the desk on my headset. However, I could  \\nnot listen in on the independent emergency phone. Not unless. I went under  \\nthe table and tapped it.\\n‘Tap the landline ,’ a faint voice echoed in my head.\\n‘No, it’s wrong,’ I said and mentally reprimanded myself.\\nI could still hear one side of the conversation though.‘Hello… Ganesh, call the landline… yes 2246343 and 11, for Delhi… Call  \\nafter ten minutes, our boss might come on his rounds soon… I knew ten  \\nminutes  is  six  hundred  seconds,  I’m  sure  you’ll  survive,  she  laughed  \\nuncontrollably and hung up. When women laugh non-stop, they’re flirting. I  \\nhate Priyanka.\\n‘He sounds so cute,’ Esha said, stretching the last word to five times its  \\nnormal length.\\n‘Enough is enough, I’m going to call Bakshi. We need to fix the systems,’  \\nI said and stood up. I couldn’t bear the systems guy lurking under the table  \\nanymore. More than that, I could not bear six-hundred-seconds-without-you  \\nsurvival stories.\\nI  was  walking  towards  Bakshi’s  office  when  I  noticed  him  walking  \\ntowards me.\\n‘Agent Sam, why aren’t you on your desk?’ Bakshi said.\\n‘I was looking for you sir,’ I said.\\n‘I’m all yours,’ Bakshi said as his face broke into a smile. He came and  \\nplaced his arm around my shoulder. I hate it when he does that.\\nBakshi and I returned to WASG. Everyone heard the sound of Bakshi’s  \\nheavy steps. Radhika hid her knitting gear under the table. Esha pout her nail  \\nfile in her bag. Vroom opened his screen to an empty MSWord document.\\nThe systems guy came out from under the table and called his boss, the  \\nhead of the IT department.\\n‘Looks like we have technology issues here’ Bakshi said and the systems  \\nguy nodded his head.\\nThe head of IT came soon after. He and the systems guy discussed geek  \\nstuff between themselves in so-called English. When the discussions were  \\nover, the IT head ranted out incomprehensible technical details to us. I only  \\nunderstood that the system was under a strain: eighty percent of the WASG  \\ncapacity was damaged, and the remaining twenty percent could not handle  \\nthe current load.\\n‘Hmmm,’  Bakshi  said,  his  left  hand  rubbing  his  chin  ‘hmmm…that’s  \\nreally bad, isn’t it?’\\n‘So, what do you want us to do?’ the IT head asked.\\nAll eyes turned to Bakshi, it was a situation Bakshi hated—to be asked to  \\ntake a decision or recommend action.\\n‘Hmmm,’ Bakshi said and flexed his knees, knee by slow knee, to buy  \\ntime. ‘We really need a methodical game plan here.’\\n‘We can shut down the WASG system tonight. Western Computers main  \\nbay is running fine anyway,’ the junior IT guy suggested.\\n‘But, WASG has one lost all its capacity. Boston won’t like it if we shut  \\nthe bay,’ the IT head said, referring to the Western Computers and appliances  \\nheadquarters in Boston.\\n‘Hmmm,’ Bakshi said again and pressed a sweaty palm on my desk.  \\n‘Upsetting Boston will not be good at this time. We are already on a slippery  \\nslope at Connexions. Let’s try to be proactively oriented here.’Vroom couldn’t resist a snigger at Bakshi’s jargon. He looked away and  \\nclenched his teeth.\\n‘Sir, can I make a suggestion,’ I said, even though I should have kept my  \\ntrap shut.\\n‘What?’ Bakshi said.\\n‘We could take Bangalore’s help,’ I said, referring to the location of the  \\nsecond Western Appliances and Computers call center in India.\\n‘Bangalore?’ Bakshi and the IT head said in unison.\\n‘Yes sir. It is thanksgiving and call volumes are low. So Bangalore will be  \\nrunning light as well. If we pass most of our calls there, it will get busier for  \\nthem, but it won’t overload them. Meanwhile, we can handle a limited flow  \\nhere,’ I said.\\n‘That makes sense. We can easily switch the flow for a few hours. We  \\ncan fix the systems here in the morning,’ the junior IT guy said.\\n‘That’s fine,’ I said. ‘And people will start their Thanksgiving dinner in  \\nthe States soon, so call volumes will fall even more.’\\nEveryone on the desk looked at me and nodded. Secretly they were  \\nthrilled  at the easy  shift tonight. Bakshi,  however, had  fallen  into silent  \\ncontemplation.\\n‘Sir, you heard what Shyam said. Let’s ask Bangalore. That is our only  \\noption,’ Priyanka said.\\nBakshi remained silent and pondered for a few more seconds. I want to  \\nknow what he actually thinks in these moments.\\n‘See, the thing is,’ Bakshi said and paused again,’…aren’t we comparing  \\napples to oranges here?’\\n‘What?’ Vroom looked at Bakshi with a disgusted expression. \\nI wondered what Bakshi was talking about. Was I the apple? Was Delhi  \\nthe orange? What fruit was Bangalore?\\n‘I have an idea. Why don’t we use Bangalore?’ Bakshi said and snapped  \\nhis fingers.\\n‘But  that  is  what  Shyam—‘  the  junior  IT  guy  began,  but  Bakshi  \\ninterrupted him. Poor junior IT guy, he isn’t familiar with Bakshi’s ways.\\n‘See, it sounds unusual, but sometimes you have to do out-of-the-box  \\nthinking. Bakshi said and tapped his head in self-administration.\\n‘Yes sir,’ I said. ‘That is a good idea. We have it all sorted now.’\\n‘Good,’ the IT guys said and started playing with the computer menus.  \\nBakshi had a smug smile on his face.\\nBefore the IT guys left they told us the WASG call volume would be  \\nsuper-light, maybe even less than twenty calls an hour. We were overjoyed,  \\nbut kept a straight face before Bakshi.\\n‘See, problem solved,’ Bakshi said and spread his hands. ‘That is what  \\nI’m here for.’\\n‘Lucky us, sir,’ Priyanka said.\\nWe thought Bakshi would leave, but he had other plans. ‘Shyam, as you  \\nare free tonight, can you help me with some strategic documents? You know,  \\nit will give you some exposure.’ ‘What is it, Sir?’ I said, not happy about sacrificing my night.\\n‘These are ten copies of the monthly data sheets I just printed out,’  \\nBakshi said and held up some documents in his right hand. ‘For some reason  \\nthe sheets didn’t come in order. It is ten page ones, then page twos and so  \\non. Can you help fix this?’\\n‘You didn’t collate them. You can choose the option when you print,’  \\nVroom said.\\n‘You can choose to collate?’ Bakshi asked, as if we’d told him about an  \\noption for brain transplants.\\n‘Ye,’ Vroom said and took some chewing gum from his drawer. He  \\npopped a piece into his mouth. ‘Anyway, it is easier to take one printout and  \\nphotocopy the est. comes out stapled too.’\\n‘I need to upgrade my technical skills. Technology changes so fast,’  \\nBakshi said. ‘But Shyam, can you help arrange and staple them this time?’\\n‘Sure,’ I said. As if I had a choice.\\nBakshi dumped the sheets on my table and left the room.\\nPriyanka looked at me with her mouth open.\\n‘What?’ I said.\\n‘I can’t believe it,’ She shook her head. ‘Why do you let him do this to  \\nyou?’\\n‘C’mon Priyanka, leave Shyam alone. Bakshi runs his life,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Exactly.  Because  he  lets  him.  Why  can’t  people  stand  up  for  \\nthemselves?’\\n I don’t know why I can’t stand up for myself, but I definitely can’t stand  \\nPriyanka’s rhetorical questions. She doesn’t understand the point, and then  \\nasks the world out aloud.\\nI tried to ignore her. However, her words had affected me. It was  \\ndifficult to focus on the sheets. I stacked the first set and was about to staple  \\nthem when Vroom said, He can’t take on Bakshi right now. Not at this time,  \\nPriyanka, they are in the mood to fire people.’\\n‘Yes thanks Vroom. Can someone explain reality? I need to make a  \\nliving. I don’t have Mr Microsoft PowerPoint waiting for me in Seattle,’ I said  \\nand pressed the stapler hard. I missed and staple pin pierced my finger.\\n‘Oww!’ I screamed loud enough to uproot Military Uncle from his desk.\\n‘What happened?’ Priyanka said and stood up.\\nI lifted my finger to show the streaks of blood. A couple of drops split  \\nonto Bakshi’s document.\\nThe girls squealed ‘eews’ in rapid succession.\\n‘Symbolism, dude. Giving your life blood to this job,’ Vroom said. ‘Can  \\nsomeone give this guy a band-aid before he makes me throw up?’\\n‘I have a band-aid,’ Esha said as the girls came up and surrounded e.  \\nWestern love to repair an injury—as long as it is not to gross.\\n‘That’s bad,’ Esha said, taking out a band-aid from her bag. She had like  \\nfifty of them.\\n‘It’s nothing. Just a minor cut,’ I said. I clenched my teeth hard as it  \\nhurt like hell.Priyanka took out a few tissues from her bag. She held my finger and  \\ncleaned the blood around it.\\n‘Ouch!’ I screamed.\\n‘Oh, the staple is still in there,’ she said. ‘We need forceps. Forceps  \\nanyone?’\\nEsha had forceps in her handbag, which I thin k she uses to rip her  \\neyebrows  out.  Girl’s  handbags  have  enough  to  make  a  survival  kit  for  \\nAntarctica.\\nPriyanka held the forceps and went to work my finger with a surgeon’s  \\nconcentration.\\n‘Here’s the culprit,’ she said as she pulled out a staple pin drenched in  \\nblood. I swear, ever since I’ve developed a fear of staple—staplophobia, you  \\ncan call it.\\nPriyanka wiped my figure and then struck the band-aid on it. With no  \\nmore fun, bloody sights to see, everyone returned to their seats. I went back  \\nto collating sheets. Perhaps my abilities really did lie in mindless labor.\\nEsha and Radhika began talking about Bakshi.\\n‘He had no idea what IT was saying,’ Radhika said.\\n‘Yeah, but did you see his face?’ Esha said. ‘He looked like he was doing  \\na CBI investigation.’\\nI looked at Priyanka. The word CBI brought back memories. Even as I  \\ncollation Bakshi’s sheets, my mind drifted to Pandara Road.#  10  \\nMy Past Dates with \\nPriyanka—II\\nHavemore Restaurant, Pandara Road\\nNine months before this night\\n‘Shyam,’ Priyanka said as she tried to push me away. ‘This is not the  \\nplace to do these things. This is Pandara Road.’\\n‘Oh really,’ I said, refusing to move away. We were sitting on a corner  \\ntable. A carved wooden screen partially hid us. ‘What’s wrong with Pandara  \\nRoad?’ I said, continuing to kiss her.\\n‘This is a family place,’ she said; she spread a palm on my face and  \\npushed me back again, firmly this time.\\n‘So, families get made by doing these things.’\\n‘Very funny. Anyway, you chose this place. I hope the food is as good as  \\nyou said it was.’\\n‘It’s the best in Delhi,’ I said. We had come to Havemore Restaurant,  \\none of the half-dozen overpriced but excellent restaurants on Pandara Road.  \\nWe had done enough museums. After the Rail Museum, we had gone to the  \\nPlanetarium (the dark empty theatre with its romantic possibilities was fun, I  \\nadmit),  the  Natural  History  Museum,  the  Doll  Museum  and  the  Science  \\nmuseum. According to Priyanka, museum offered good privacy, great gardens  \\nand cheap canteens.\\n‘A hundred and thirty bucks for daal’ Priyanka exclaimed as she opened  \\nthe menu. Her kohl-lined eyes expression of a stunned cartoon character. It  \\nwas embarrassing, especially as the waite.- was already at out table to take  \\nthe order.\\n‘Just order okay?’ I said in a hushed voice.\\nPriyanka took five more minutes to place the order. Here is how she  \\ndecides. Step two: r-sort the cheaper ones based on calories.\\n‘One naan, no butter. Yellow daal,’ she said as I glared at her.\\n‘Okay, not yellow, black daal,’ she said. ‘And…’\\n‘And one shahi paneer,’ I said.\\n‘You always order the same thing, black daal and shahi paneer,’ she  \\nmade a face.\\n‘Yes, same girl, same food. Why bother experimenting when you already  \\nhave the best,’ I said.\\n‘You are so cute,’ she said. Her smile  made her eyes crinkle. She  \\npinched my cheeks and fed me a little vinegar-onion from the table. Hardly  \\nromantic, but I liked it. \\nShe moved he hand away quickly when she saw a family being led to the  \\ntable adjacent to us. The family consisted of a young married couple, their  little daughters and an old lady. The daughters were twins, probably four  \\nyears old.\\nThe entire family had morose faces and no one said a word to each  \\nother. I wondered why they had come out when they could be grumpy for  \\nfree at home.\\n‘Anyway,’ Priyanka said, ‘what’s the news?’\\n‘Not much, Vroom and I are busy with the troubleshooting website.’\\n‘Cool, how’s it coming along?’\\n‘Really well. Nothing fancy though: the best websites are simple. Vroom  \\neven checked out many sites meant for mentally handicapped people. He said  \\nif we can model it on such websites. Americans will surely be able to use it.’\\n‘They’re  not  that dumb,’  Priyanka  laughed.  ‘Americans  invented  \\ncomputers remembers remember?’\\nThe waiter came with our food.\\n‘Yeah, American has like ten smart guys. The rest call us at night,’ I  \\nsaid, as I tore a piece of my naan and dipped it in the daal.\\n‘I agree the people who call us are pretty thick. I’m like—figure out  \\nwhere the power button is, hello/’ she said.\\nShe put micro-portions of food on her plate.\\n‘Eat properly,’ I said. ‘Stop dieting all the time like Esha.’\\n‘I am not that hungry,’ she said, even as I forcefully gave her human  \\nportions of food.\\n‘Hey, did I tell you about Esha?’ Don’t tell anyone,’ she said, her voice  \\ndipping, eyebrow dancing.\\nI shock my head. ‘You love to gossip. Don’t you? Your name should be  \\nMiss Gossip FM 99.5,’ I said.\\n‘I never gossip,’ she said, waving a fork at me solemnly. ‘Oh my God,  \\nthe food is so good here.’\\nMy chest inflated with pride as if he had spent all night cooking the  \\ndishes myself.\\n‘Of Course you love to gossip. Whenever someone starts with “don’t you  \\nanymore’, that to me is a juicy tit-bit of gossip coming,’ I said.\\nPriyanka blushed and the tip of the nose turned tomato-red. She looked  \\ncute as hell. I would have kissed her right then, but the grumpy family next to  \\nus was beginning  to argue murmurs. I did  not want to spoil  the somber  \\nambience for them.\\n‘Okay so may be I gossip, but only a little bit,’ Priyanka relented. ‘But I  \\nread somewhere, gossip is good for you.\\n‘Oh really?’ I teased.\\n‘Yes, it’s a sign you’re interested in people and care for them.’\\n‘That  is  so  lame,’  I  burst  out  laughing,  pointing  my  spoon  at  her.  \\n‘Anyway, what about Esha. I know Vroom has the hots for her. But does she  \\nlike him/’\\n‘No  Shyam,  which  is  old  news.  She  has  rejected  Vroom’s  proposal  \\nbefore. The latest is that she had signed up for the Femina Miss India contest.  Last week she is five-five, the minimum is five-six. Radhika saw her cry in the  \\ntoilet.’\\n‘Oh wow! Miss India?’\\n‘C’mon, she is not that pretty. She should really stop this modeling trip  \\nof hers. God, she is so thin though. Okay, I’m not eating anymore.’ She  \\npushed her plate away.\\n‘Stupid, eat. You want to be happy on thin?’ I said, pushing her plate  \\nback towards her.\\n‘Thin.’\\n‘Shut up, eat properly. The name of the restaurant should tell you  \\n[something. And s for Esha, well too bad Miss India didn’t work out. However,  \\ntrying doesn’t hurt,’ I said.\\n‘Well, she was crying. So it hurt  her. After all, she’s come to Delhi  \\nagainst her parent’s wishes. It’s not easy struggling alone,’ she said.\\nI nodded.\\nWe finished our meal and the waiter reappeared like a genie to clear  \\nour plates.\\n‘Dessert?’ I said\\n‘No way. I’m too full,’ Priyanka said, placing her hand on her neck to  \\nshow just how full. She is way too dramatic sometimes, just like her mom. Not  \\nthat I dare tell her that. \\n‘Okay, one kulfi please,’ I said to the waiter.\\n‘No, order gulab jamun, no?’ she said.\\n‘Huh? I thought you didn’t want…okay, one gulab jamun please.’\\n‘Same. We haven’t had a cry fest since last week’s showdown, so that  \\nalone is a reason to celebrate. Maybe I will have half a gulab jamun.’\\n‘And what happened last week?’\\n‘Last week? Oh yes, my uncles were over for dinner. So picture this:  \\ndinner ends and we are all having butterscotch ice cream at the dinning table.  \\nOne uncle mentioned that my cousin was getting married to a doctor, a  \\ncardiac surgeon or something,’ Priyanka said.\\nThe water came and gave us the gulab jamuns. I took a bite.\\n‘Ouch, careful, these are hot,’ I said, blowing air out ‘Anyway, what  \\nhappened then?’\\n‘So I’m eating my ice cream and my mother screams “Priyanka, make  \\nsure you marry someone well settled”.’ The latter phrase was said in falsetto.\\n‘I’m going to be a team leader soon,’ I said and fed her a slice of gulab  \\njamun.\\n‘Relax, Shyam,’ Priyanka said, as she took a bite and patted my arm. ‘it  \\nhas nothing to do with you. The point is how could she spring it on me in front  \\nof everyone. Like, why can’t just have ice cream like the others. Why does  \\nmy serving have to come with this hot guilt sauce. My younger brother,  \\nnobody says anything to him while he stuffs his face.’\\nI laughed and signaled for the bill.\\n‘So what did you do then?’ I said.\\n‘Nothing. I slammed my spoon down on the plate and left the room.’‘Major drama, you are no less,’ I said.\\n‘Guess what she says then, to everyone, “This is what I get for bringing  \\nher up and loving her so much. She doesn’t care. I nearly died in labour when  \\nshe was born, but she doesn’t care”.’\\nI laughed uncontrollably as Priyanka did an outstanding imitation of her  \\nmother. The bill arrived and my eyebrows shot up for a second as I paid the  \\nfour hundred and sixty three bucks.\\nWe stood up to leave and the grumpy family’s voices reached us.\\n‘What to do? Since the day this woman came to our house, our family’s  \\nfortunes have been ruined,’ the old woman was saying. ‘The Agra girl’s side  \\nwere offering to set up a full clinic. I don’t know where our brains were  \\nthen.’\\nThe daughter-in-law had tears in her eyes. She had not touched her  \\nfood. The man was eating nonchalantly.\\n‘Look at her now, sitting there with a stiff face. Go, go to hell now. Not  \\nonly did you not bring anything, now you have dumped these two girls like  \\ntwo curses on me,’ the mother-in-law said.\\nI looked at the little girls. They had identical plaints with cute pink  \\nribbons in them. The girls were holding one hand of their mother each. They  \\nlooked scared.\\nPriyanka was starting at them. I noticed they had ordered kulfi and  \\nwondered if I should have done the same and at least saved my now scalded  \\ntongue.\\n‘Say  something  now, you silent statue,’ the  mother-in-law  said  and  \\nshook the daughter-in-law’s shoulders.\\n‘Why doesn’t she say anything?’ Priyanka whispered to me.\\n‘Because she can’t,’ I said. ‘When you have a bad boss, you can’t say  \\nanything.’\\n‘Who will pay for these two curses? Say something now,’ the mother-in-\\nlaw said. The daughter-in-law’s tears came down faster.\\n‘I’ll say something,’ Priyanka shouted, facing the mother-in-law.\\nThe grumpy family turned to look at us in astonishment. I looked for a  \\ndeep to hide myself from the embarrassment.\\n‘Who are you?’ she husband asked, probably his first words during the  \\nentire meal\\n‘We’ll worry about that later,’ Priyanka said, ‘but who the hell are you/  \\nher husband I presume?’\\n‘Huh? Yes I am. Madam, this is a family matter,’ he said. \\n‘Oh really? You call this is a family? Doesn’t look like a family to me,’  \\nPriyanka said. ‘I just see an old shrew and a loser wimp who are troubling  \\nthese girls. Don’t you have any shame? Is this what you married her for?’\\n‘See, here is another one,’ the mother-in-law said. ‘Look at the girls of  \\ntoday” don’t know how to talk—look at her, eyes made up like a heroine.’\\n‘The young girls know how to talk and behave. It is you old ones who  \\nneed to be taught a lesson. These are your granddaughters, and you are  calling them  curses?’ Priyanka  said, her nose a  cuter red  than  before. I  \\nwanted to takes picture of that nose.\\n‘Whom are you madam? What is your business here?’ the husband said,  \\nthis time in a firmed voice.\\n‘I’ll tell you who I am,’ Priyanka said and fumbled in her handbag. She  \\ntook out her call center id card and flashed it for a nanosecond. ‘Priyanka  \\nSinha, CBI, Women’s Cell.’ \\n‘What?’ the husband said, in half-disbelief.\\n‘What is your car number?’ Priyanka said, talking in a flat voice.\\n‘What?’ Why?’ the bewildered husband asked.\\n‘Or should I go outside to check,’ she said and glanced at the keys on  \\nthe table. ‘Santro, isn’t it?’\\n‘DGI 463. Why?’ the husband said.\\nPriyanka  took out her  cell  phone  and  pretended  to call  a  number.  \\n‘Hello? Sinha here. Please retrieve records on DGI 463...yes...Santro…thanks.’\\n‘Madam, what is going on?’ the husband said, his voice quivering.\\n‘Three years. Harassing women in punishable for three years. Quick  \\ntrial, no appeal,’ Priyanka said and started t the mother-in-law.\\nThe old woman pulled one of the twin granddaughter onto her lap.\\n‘What?  Madam  this  is  just  a  f-f-f-family  affair  and…’  the  husband  \\nstammered.\\n‘Don’t’ say family!’ Priyanka said, her voice loud.\\n‘Madam,’ the mother-in-law said, her tone now sweet, as if someone  \\nhad soaked her vocal cords in gulab jamuns, ‘we are just here to have a meal.  \\nI don’t even let her cook see, we just had—’\\n‘—Shut up! We have your records now. We will keep track. If you mess  \\naround, your son and you can have lost of meals together—in jail.’\\n‘Sorry madam,’ the husband said with folded hands. He asked for the  \\nbill and fumbled for cash. Within a minute, they had paid and left.\\nI looked at Priyanka with my mouth open.\\n‘Don’t say anything,’ she said, ‘let’s go.’\\n‘CBI?’ I said.\\n‘Don’t. Let’s go.’\\nWe sat in the Qualis I had borrowed from the call center driver.\\n‘Stupid old witch,’ Priyanka said. I started to drive. Five minutes later,  \\nPriyanka turned to me. ‘Okay, you can say what you want now.’\\n‘I love you,’ I said.\\n‘What? Why this now?’\\n‘Because, I love it when you stand up for something that you feel for.  \\nAnd that you do such a horrible job of acting like a CBI inspector. I love it  \\nwhen you want to order the cheapest dishes only because I’m paying for  \\nthem. I love the kohl in your eyes. I love it when your eyes light up when you  \\nhave gossip for me. I love it that you say you don’t want dessert and then ask  \\nme to change mine so you can have half. I love your stories about your  \\nmother. I love it that you believe in me and are patient with my career.  \\nActually, you know what, Priyanka?’ I said.‘What?’\\n‘I may not be a heart surgeon—but the one little heart I have, I have  \\ngiven it to you.’\\nPriyanka laughed aloud and put her hand on her face. ‘Sorry,’ she said  \\nand shook her head, still laughing. ‘Sorry, you were doing so well, but for the  \\nheart surgeon line. Now, that is seriously cheesy.’\\n‘You know what,’ I said and removed one hand from the steering wheel  \\nto tweak her nose. ‘They should put you in jail for killing romantic lines.’#11\\n‘I can’t believe this,’ Radhika said and threw her mobile phone on her  \\ndesk, breaking up my Pandara Road dream.\\nEveryone turned to look at her. She covered her face with her hands  \\nand took a couple of deep breaths.\\n‘What’s up,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Nothing,’ Radhika said and heaved a sigh. She looked upset, but also  \\nyounger at the same time. Five years ago, Radhika must have been pretty, I  \\nthought.\\n‘Tell no,’ Esha said.\\n‘It’s Anuj. Sometimes he can be so unreasonable.’ She said and showed  \\nher phone to Esha. On the screen was an SMS message.\\n‘What is it?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Read it out,’ Radhika said as she fumbled through her bag for her anti-\\nmigraine pills. ‘damn, I only have one pill left.’ \\n‘Really? Okay.’ Esha said and started reading the message:\\n’Show  elders  respect.  Act  like  a  daughter-in-law  should.  \\nGoodnight.’\\n‘What did I do wrong/ I was in a hurry, that is all, Radhika mumbled to  \\nherself as she took her pill with a sip of water.\\nEsha put a hand on her shoulder.\\n‘What happened?’ Esha asked softly. Women do this so well: a few  \\nseconds  ago she was squealing in excitement over Ganesh, now she was  \\nwhispering in concern over Anuj. \\n‘Anuj is in Kolkata on tour. He called home and my mother-in-law told  \\nhim “Radhika made a face when I told her to crush the almonds a bit finer”.  \\nCan you believe it? I was running to catch the Qualis and still made her milk,’  \\nRadhika said and started to press her forehead.\\n‘Is this what mom and son talk about?’ Priyanka said.\\nRadhika continued, ‘And then she told him, “I am old, if the pieces are  \\ntoo big they will choke my food pipe. Maybe Radhika is trying to kill me.” Why  \\nwould she say something so horrible?’\\n‘And you’re still knitting a scarf for her?’ Vroom said, pointing at the  \\nknotting needles.\\n‘Trust  me,  being  a  daughter-in-law  is  harder  than  being  a  model,’  \\nRadhika said. The pill was starting to have an effect: her face was looking  \\ncalm again. ‘Anyway, leave my boring life and me. What’s up? Ganesh calling  \\nsoon or what?’\\n‘Are you okay?’ Esha said, still holding Radhika’s arm.\\n‘Yes,  I’m  fine.  Sorry  guys,  I  overreacted.  It’s  just  a  little  \\nmiscommunication between Anuj and me.’\\n‘Looks like your mother-in-law likes melodrama. She should meet you  \\nmother,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Really?’ Radhika said.‘Oh yes. She is the Miss Universe of melodrama. We cry together at least  \\nonce a week. Though today, she is on cloud nine,’ Priyanka said. She pulled  \\nthe landline closer to her.\\nMy attention was diverted by a call flashing on my screen.\\n‘I’ll take it,’ I said, raising my hand. ‘Western Appliances, Sam speaking,  \\nhow may I help you?’\\nIt was one of my weird calls of the night. The caller was from Virginia  \\nand was having trouble defrosting his fridge. It took me four minutes to figure  \\nout  the  reason.  Turns  out  the  caller  was  a  ‘big  person’,  which  is  what  \\nAmericans call fat people. Hence his fingers were too thick to turn the tiny  \\nknob  in  the  fridge’s  compartment  that  would  activate  the  defrosting  \\nmechanism. I suggested that he use a screwdriver or a knife. Fortunately, that  \\nsolution worked after seven attempts.\\n‘Thanks you for calling Western Appliances, sir,’ I said and ended the  \\ncall.\\n‘More politeness, agent Sam. Be more courteous,’ I heard Bakshi’s voice  \\nand felt his heavy breath on my neck.\\n‘Sir, you again?’ I said and turned around. Bakshi’s face was as shiny as  \\never. So oily, he probably slipped off his pillow every night.\\n‘Sorry, I forgot something important,’ he said. ‘Have you guys done by  \\nthe Western Computers website manual? I am finally sending the project  \\nreport to Boston.’\\n‘Yes sir. Vroom and I finished it yesterday.’ I said and took out a copy  \\nfrom my drawer.\\n‘Hmm,’ Bakshi said as he scanned the cover sheet.\\nWestern computers troubleshooting Website\\nUser Manual and Project Details\\nDeveloped by Connexions, Delhi\\nShyam Mehra and Varun Malhotra\\n(Sam Mason and Victor Mell)\\n‘Do you have a soft copy that you can email me/’ Bakshi said. ‘Boston  \\nwants it urgently.’\\n‘Yes sir,’ Vroom said, pointing to his computers, ‘I have it stored here.  \\nI’ll send it to you.’\\n‘Also, did you dot eh collation, Sam?’ \\n‘Yes sir,’ I said and passed him the ten sets.\\n‘Excellent. I empowered you, and you delivered the output. Actually, I  \\nhave another document, the board meeting invite. Can you help?’\\n‘What do I have to do?’ I said.\\n‘Here is a copy,’ Bakshi said and gave me a five-page document. ‘I  \\ndidn’t print more this time. Can you Xerox ten copies for me please? My  \\nsecretary is off today.’‘Err. Sure Sir, just Xeroxing right?’\\nBakshi nodded.\\n‘Sir,’ Vroom said, ‘what is the board meeting for?’\\n‘Nothing, just routine management issues,’ Bakshi said.\\n‘Are people going to get fired?’ Vroom asked, his direct question making  \\neveryone spring to attention.\\n‘Err… ‘Bakshi said, at his usual loss for words when asked something  \\nmeaningful. \\n‘There are rumors in the Western Computers main bay. We just want to  \\nknow it we will be fine,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Western Appliances won’t be affected, right/’ Esha said.\\nBakshi took a deep breath and said, ‘I can’t say much. All I can say is we  \\nare under pressure to right size ourselves.’\\n‘Right size?’ Radhika asked in genuine confusion.\\n‘That means people are getting fired, right?’ Vroom said. Right size  \\nnever meant otherwise.\\nBakshi did not respond.\\n‘Sir, we need to increase our sales force to get new clients. Firing  \\npeople is not the answer,’ Vroom said, with a boldness that was high even by  \\nhis standards.\\nBakshi had a smirk on his face as he turned to Vroom. He put his hand  \\non Vroom’s shoulder. ‘I like your excitement Mr Victor,’ he said,  ‘but a  \\nseasoned management has to study all underlying variable and come up with  \\nan optimal solution. It is not so simple.’\\n‘But sir, we can get more…’ Vroom was saying as Bakshi patted his  \\nshoulder twice and left.\\nVroom waited to ensure that Bakshi was out of the room before he  \\nspoke again.\\n‘this  is  insanity.  Bakshi’s  fucked  up  the  place  and  they  are  firing  \\ninnocent agents he said, his voice at shouting levels.\\n‘Stay clam,’ I said, and started assembling the sheets.\\n‘Yes stay calm. Like Mr Xerox Boy here—finds acceptance in everything,’  \\nPriyanka said.\\n‘Excuse me,’ I said looking up. ‘Are you talking about me?’\\nPriyanka kept quiet. I felt agitated inside and just had to respond.\\n‘What is your problem? I come here, make fifteen grand a month and go  \\nhome. It shucks that people are being fired, and I am trying to do my best to  \\nsave my job. Overall, yes I accept my situation. And Vroom, before I forget,  \\ncan you email Bakshi the user manual please?’\\n ‘I’m doing it, Vroom said, as he clicked his mouse, ‘though what is  \\nhappening here is still wrong.’\\n‘Don’t worry. We’ve done the website. We should be safe,’ I said.\\n‘You have pizza that often?’ Esha said.\\n‘Isn’t it unhealthy?’ Radhika asked. Despite the SMS argument, she was  \\nback to knitting her scarf. Knitting habits die hard I guess.‘No way. Pizzas are the ultimate balanced diet. Look at the contents:  \\ngrain  in  the  curst,  milk  protein  in  the  cheese,  vegetables  and  meat  as  \\ntoppings. It has all the food groups. I read it on the Internet—pizza is good for  \\nyou.’\\n‘You and your Net,’ Esha said. It was true. Vroom got all his information  \\noff the internet—bikes, jobs, politics,, dating tips and, as I had just learnt,  \\npizza nutrition as well.\\n‘Pizzas are not healthy. I gain weight so fast if I have a lot of it,’  \\nPriyanka said, ‘especially with my lifestyle. I hardly get time to exercise. On  \\ntop of that, I jut sit and work in a confined space.’\\n‘Priyanka’s last two words made my heart skip a beat. ‘Confined space’  \\nmeans only one thing to me—that night at the 32nd Milestone disco.#12\\nMy Past Dates with \\nPriyanka—III\\n32nd Miltestone, Gurgaon Highway\\nSeven months before this night\\nI should not really call this one a date, since this time it was a group  \\nthing with Vroom and Esha joining us. I argued earlier with Priyanka about  \\ngoing out with work people, but she told me I should be less anti-social.  \\nVroom picked 32nd milestone and the girls agreed because the disc had no  \\ndoor-bitch. According to Priyanka, a door-bitch is the hostess who stands  \\noutside the disco. She screens every girl walking in, and if your waist is more  \\nthan twenty-four inches, or if you were not wearing something right out of an  \\nitem number, the door-bitch will raise an eyebrow at you like you are a fifty-\\nyear-old aunty.\\n‘Really? I never noticed those door girls before,’ I said as we took stools  \\nat the bar.\\n‘It’s a girl to girl thing. They size you up, and unless you are drop dead  \\ngorgeous, you get that mental smirk,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘So why should you care? You are gorgeous,’ I said. She smiled and  \\npinched my cheek.\\n‘Mental  smirk? Girls  and  their coded  communication. Anyway,  drink  \\nanyone?’ Vroom said.\\n‘Long Island Ice tea please,’ Esha said and I noticed how stunning she  \\nlooked with make-up. She wore a black fitted top and black pants. Her pants  \\nwere so tight, she would probably have to roll them down when removing  \\nthem.\\n‘Long Island? Want to get drunk quick or what?’ I said.\\n‘C’mon. I need to de-stress. I ran around like mad last month chasing  \\nmodeling agencies. Besides, I have to wash down last week’s one thousand  \\ncalls,’ Esha said.\\n‘That’s right. Twelve hundred calls for me,’ Vroom said. ‘Let’s all have  \\nLong Islands.’\\n‘Vodka  cran  for me  please,’ Priyanka  said. She  wore  camel-colored  \\npants and a pistachio-green sequined kurti. I had given her the kurti as a gift  \\non her last birthday. She had just a hint of eyeliner and a gift on her last  \\nbirthday. I preferred it to Esha’s Asian Paints job.\\n‘Any luck with modeling assignments?’ I idly asked Esha.\\n‘Not much. I did meet talent agent. He said he would refer me to some  \\ndesigners and fashion show producers. I need to be seen in those circles,’  \\nEsha said as she pulled her top down to cover her navel.Vroom went to the bartender to collect our drinks. I scanned the disc.  \\nThe place had two levels: a dance floor on the mezzanine and a lounge bar on  \\nthe first floor. A remixed version of Dil Chahta Hai played in the background.  \\nAs it was Saturday night, the disc had more than three hundred customers.  \\nThey were all rich, or at least had rich friends who could afford drinks at over  \\nRs 300 a cocktail. Our budget was a lavish thousand bucks each: a treat for  \\nmaking it through the extremely busy summer period at the call center.\\nI noticed some stick-thin models on the dance floor. Their stomachs  \\nwere so flat, If they swallowed a pill you would probably see an outline of it  \\nwhen it landed inside. Esha’s looks are similar, except she is a bit short.\\n‘Check it out. She is totally anorexic. I can bet on it,’ Priyanka said,  \\npointing to a pale-complexioned model on the dance floor. She wore a top  \\nwithout any sleeves or neck or collar. I guess the girls call it ‘off-shoulder’.  \\nDefying physics, it did not slip off, though most men waited patiently. \\nThe  pale-complexioned  model  turned,  displaying  a  completely  bare  \\nback.\\n‘Wow, I wish I were that thin. But, oh my god, look at what she is  \\nwearing,’ Esha said.\\n‘I can’t believe she is not wearing a bra, must be totally flat,’ Priyanka  \\nsaid,\\n‘Girls’ I said.\\n‘Yes? Esha and Priyanka turned to me.\\n‘I’m  bored.  Can  you  choose  more  inclusive  conversation  topics,’  I  \\npleaded. I looked for Vroom, he had collected the drinks and was waving  \\nmanically at us for help.\\n‘I’ll go,’ Esha said and went over to Vroom. \\nFinally, to my relief, it was only Priyanka and I.\\n‘So,’ she said as she leaned forward to peck at my lips. ‘You’re feeling  \\nleft out with our girlie talk?’\\n‘Well, this was supposed to be a date. I forced myself to come with  \\nthem. I haven’t caught up with you in ages.’\\n‘I  told  you,  Vroom  asked  me  and  I  didn’t  want  to  be  anti-social,’  \\nPriyanka said as she ruffled my hair. ‘But we’ll go out for a walk in a bit. I  \\nwant to be alone with you too, you know?’ \\n‘Pleas, let’s go soon.’\\n‘Sure, but they’re here now,’ Priyanka said as Vroom and Esha arrived.  \\nVroom passed us our drinks. We said ‘cheers’, and tried to sound lively and  \\nhappy, as everyone in a disc always should.\\n‘Congrats on the website guys. I heard it’s good,’ Esha said as he took a  \\nsip.\\n‘The website is cool,’ Vroom said. ‘The test customers love it. No more  \\ndialing. And it’s so simple—just right for those spoon-feed-me Americans.’\\n‘So, promotion finally  coming for Mr Shyam  here,’; Priyanka said. I  \\nnoticed she had finished a third of her drink in just two sips.\\n‘Now Mr Shyam’s promotion is another story,’ Vroom said. ‘Maybe My  \\nShyam would like to tell it himself.’‘Please man. Some other time,’ I said even as Priyanka looked at me  \\nexpectantly.\\n‘Okay, well Bakshi said he is talking to Boston to release headcount. But  \\nit will take a while.’\\n‘Why can’t you just be firm with him?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Like how? How can you be firm with your own boss?’ I said, my voice  \\nloud with irritation.\\n ‘Cool it guys,’ Vroom said. ‘It’s party night and—‘ \\nA big noise interrupted our conversation. We noticed a commotion on  \\nthe dance floor as the DJ turned off the music.\\n‘What’s up?’ Vroom said and we all went towards the dance floor.\\nA fight had broken out on the floor. A gang of drunken friends had  \\nthought someone had pawed one of the girls with them. They accused that  \\nsomeone else and grabbed his collar. Soon, Mr Accused’s own gang came to  \\nhis defense. As the dance floor was too noisy for vocal arguments, people  \\nexpressed themselves only with fists and kicks. The music stopped when  \\nsomeone knocked one guy flat on the floor. Several others were on top of  \\neach other. Bouncers finally disentangled everyone and restored peace. A  \\nstretcher emerged to carry away the knocked-out guy.\\n‘Man, I wish it had gone on a bit longer,’ Vroom said.\\nIt’s true. The only thing better than watching beautiful people in a disc  \\nis watching a fight. A fight means the party is totally rocking.\\nFive minutes later the music was back and occupying the floor again was  \\nthe anorexic girl’s brigade.\\n‘That is what happens to kids with rich dads and too much money,’  \\nVroom said.\\n‘C’mon Vroom. I thought you said money is good. That is how we’ll beat  \\nthe Americans, right?’ Priyanka said with the confidence that comes after  \\ndrinking a Long Island Iced Tea in seven minutes.\\n‘Yes, doesn’t money pay for your mobile phones, pizzas and discos?’ I  \\nasked.\\n‘Yes, but the difference is that I’ve earned it. These rich kids, they have  \\nno clue how hard it is to make cash,’ Vroom said and held up his glass. ‘This  \\ndrink is three hundred bucks—it takes me almost a full night of two hundred  \\nirritating Americans screaming into my ear to earn it. Then I get this drink.  \\nWhich is full of ice-cubes anyway. These kids can’t make that comparison.’\\n‘Oh, I feel so guilty drinking this now, Priyanka said.\\n‘C’mon, you get good money. Significantly more than the eight grand  \\nyou made as a journalist trainee,’ I said.\\n‘Yes,’ Vroom said as he took a big hundred-and-twenty-rupees sip. ‘We  \\nget paid well, fifteen thousand a month. Fuck, that is almost twelve dollars a  \\nday. Wow I make as much a day as a US burger boy makes in two hours. Not  \\nbad for my college degree. Not bad at all. Fucking nearly double of what I  \\nmade as a journalist anyway.’ He pushed his empty glass and it slid to the  \\nother end of the table.Everyone  was  silent  for  a  minute.  Vroom  on  his  temper  trip  is  \\nunbearable. \\n‘Stop being so depressed. Let’s dance,’ Esha said and tugged at Vroom’s  \\nhand.\\n‘No,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Come for one song,’ Esha said and stood up from her stool.\\n‘Okay, but if anyone teases you, I’m not getting into a fight,’ Vroom  \\nsaid.\\n‘Don’t worry, no one will. There are prettier girls here,’ Esha said.\\n‘I don’t think so. Anyway, let’s go,’ Vroom said as they went tot eh  \\ndance floor. The song playing was Sharara Sharara , one of Esha’s favorites.\\nPriyanka and I watched them dance from our seats.\\n‘Want to go for a walk now?’ Priyanka said after a few minutes.\\n‘Sure,’ I said. We held hands and walked out of 32nd Milestone. The  \\nbouncer at the door stamped our palms so that we could re-enter the disco.  \\nWe headed to the parking lot, as the music was softer there. My ears never  \\nfelt so nice. \\n‘It’s so calm here,’ Priyanka said. ‘I don’t like it when Vroom gets all  \\nworked  up.  The  boy  needs  to  control  his  temper.  Top  much  unchecked  \\naggression going on there.’\\n‘He’s young and confused. Don’t worry, life will slap him into shape. I  \\nthink he regrets moving to Connexions sometimes. Besides, he had not taken  \\nhis dad and mom’s separation so well.  It shows now and then.’\\n‘Still, he should get a grip on himself. Get a steady girlfriend maybe,  \\nthat will help him relax.’\\n‘I think he likes Esha,’ I said.\\n‘I don’t know if Esha is interested. She’s quite focused on her modeling  \\ntrip.’\\nWe  reached  our  Qualis.  I  opened  the  door  to  take  out  a  pack  of  \\ncigarettes.\\n‘No smoking near me,’ she said and grabbed the pack from me.\\n‘See, maybe it is not such a good idea to have a steady girlfriend,’ I  \\nsaid.\\n‘Really? So Mr Shyam is having second thoughts?’ she said, tilting her  \\nhead.\\n‘No,’ I said, and opened the Qualis again. I took out a bottle.\\n‘What’s that?’ she asked.\\n‘Some Bacardi we keep handy. It’s three hundred bucks for a drink  \\ninside, the cost of this whole bottle.\\n‘Cool. You guys are smart,’ Priyanka said and pulled at my cheek. Then  \\nshe took a sip from the bottle.\\n‘Careful. There’s no need to get drunk just because it’s free.’\\n‘Trust me. There is a need when you a have a psycho parent.’\\n‘What happened now?’\\n‘Nothing. I don’t want to talk about her today. Let’s do a shot.’ The  \\nbottle’s lid acted as one cup, and I broke the top of a cigarette packet for the  other. We poured Bacardi into both and warmth traveled down from my lips  \\nto my insides as we tossed down our first shot.\\n‘I’m sorry about the Bakshi comment I made inside,’ she said.\\n‘It’s alright. Doesn’t matter,’ I said, and wondered if we should do shot  \\nnumber two now or later.\\n‘I can be a bitch sometimes. But I do make it up to you. I’m a loving  \\nperson, no?’ she said, high from mixing her drinks.\\n‘You’re  just  fine,’  I  said  and  looked  at  her  moist  eyes.  Her  nose  \\npuckered up a bit and I could have looked at it forever.\\n‘So, she said.\\n‘So what?’ I said, still hypnotized by her nose.\\n‘Why are you looking at me like that?’ she said and smiled.\\n‘Like what?’\\n‘The come-hither look. I see mischief in your eyes, mister,’ she said  \\nplayfully, grabbing both my hands.\\n‘There is no mischief—that’s just your imagination,’ I said.\\n‘We’ll see,’ she said and came up close. We hugged as she kissed me on  \\nmy neck.\\n‘Listen,’ she said.\\n‘What?’ I mumbled.\\n‘When was the last time we made love?’\\n‘Oh, don’t even ask. It’s really pathetic—over a month ago.’ \\nIt was true. The only place we made love was my house when it was  \\nempty. However, recently my mom had started staying more at home because  \\nof the cold. She had even given up her favorite past time of meeting relatives.\\n‘Have you ever made love in confined spaces?’\\n‘What?’ I said loudly, right into her ear.\\n‘Ouch!’ she said, rubbing her ear. ‘Hello? You heard me right?’\\n‘What are you talking about?’\\n‘Well, we have the time, soft music and a desolate spot.’\\n‘So?’\\n‘So, step into the Qualis, my friend,’ she said and opened the door. I  \\nclimbed into the backseat and she followed me.\\nOur Qualis was parked right behind the disco, and we could hear the  \\nmusic  of  we  were  quiet.  The  song  changed  to  Mahi  Ve from  the  movie  \\nKaante.\\n‘I love this song,’ she said and sat astride my lap, facing me.\\n‘It’s a pole dancer song. You know that?’ I said.\\n‘yes. But I like the lyrics. Their love is true, but fate has something else  \\nin store.’\\n‘I never focus on the lyrics.’\\n‘You just notice the scantily clad girls in the video,’ she said and ran her  \\nfingers through my hair. \\nI stayed silent.\\n‘So, you didn’t answer my question—have you made love in confined  \\nspaces?’ she said.‘Priyanka, are you crazy or are you drunk?’\\nShe unbuttoned the top few buttons of my shirt. ‘Both, Okay mister, the  \\nthing about confined spaces is that you have to cooperate. Now move your  \\nhands out of the way,’ she said.\\nWe were quiet, apart from our breathing.\\nShe confirmed that the windows were shut and ordered me to remove  \\nmy shirt. She took off her kurti first, and then slowly unhooked her bra.\\n‘be  careful  with  your  clothes,  we’ll  need  to  find  them  quickly  \\nafterwards,’ she said.\\n‘Are you mad…’ I gasped even as I raised my arms so she could pull my  \\nshirt over my head. She moved to keep my shirt aside and her foot landed on  \\nmy left baby toe.\\n‘Ouch!’ I screamed.\\n‘Oops, sorry,’ she said in a naughty-apologetic tone. As she moved her  \\nfoot away, her head hit the roof.\\n‘Ouch,’ she said. ‘Sorry, this isn’t as elegant as in the Titanic movie.’\\n‘It’s alright. Clumsy sex is better than choreographed sex. And certainly  \\nbetter than no sex,’ I said as I pulled her close.\\n‘By the way, do you have a condom?’ she said.\\n‘Yes sir. We live in constant hope,’ I said as I pulled out my wallet.\\nWe laughed as she embraced me. She started kissing me on my face. I  \\nkissed her shoulders. In a few moments, I forgot I was in the company Qualis. \\nTwenty  minutes  later  we  collapsed  in  each  other’s  arms  on  the  \\nbackseat.\\n‘Amazing. That is simply amazing, Ms Priyanka.’ \\n‘My pleasure, Sir,’ she said and winked at me. ‘Can we lie here and talk  \\nfor a while?’\\n‘Sure,’ I said, reaching for my clothes.\\nShe cuddled me again after we had dressed.\\n‘Do you love me?’ she asked. Her voice was serious.\\n‘More than anybody else on this planet, and that includes me,’ I said,  \\ncaressing her hair.\\n‘You think I’m a caring person?’ she said. Her voice told me she was  \\nclose to tears.\\n‘Why do you keep asking me that?’ I said.\\n‘My mother was looking at our family album today. She stopped at a  \\npicture of me when I was three years old: I’m sitting on a tricycle and my  \\nmother is pushing me. She saw that picture, and you know what she said?’\\n‘What?’\\n‘She said I was so cute when I was three.’\\n‘You’re cute now,’ I said pressed her nose like a button.\\n‘And she said I was solving and caring then and that I wasn’t so loving  \\nanymore. She said she always wondered what had made me so heartless…’  \\nPriyanka said and burst into tears.I held her tight and felt her body shake. I thought hard about what I  \\ncould say. Guys can never figure out what to say in such emotional moments  \\nand always end up saying something stupid.\\n‘Your mother is crazy…’\\n‘Don’t say anything about my mother. I love her. Can you just listen to  \\nme for five minutes?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Of course. Sorry…’ I said as her sobs grew louder. I swore to myself to  \\nstay quiet for the next five minutes. I started counting my breath to pass the  \\ntime. Sixteen a minute is my average; eighty breaths would mean I had  \\nlistened to her for five minutes.\\n‘We weren’t always like this. My mom and I were best friends. Until  \\nclass eight I think. Then as I became older, she became crazier,’ she said.\\nI wondered if I should point out that she had just told me not to call her  \\nmum crazy. However, I had promised myself I would keep quiet.\\n‘She had different rules for me and my brother. And that began to  \\nbother me. She would comment on everything I wore, everywhere I went,  \\nwhereas my brother…she would never say anything to him. I tried to explain it  \\nto her, but  she just became more  irritating, and  by  the  time I reached  \\ncollege, I couldn’t wait to get away from her.’\\n‘Uh-uh,’ I said, calculating that almost half my time must have passed.  \\nMy leg was cramping. When sex is over, confined spaces are a pain.\\n‘All through college I ignored her and did what I wanted. In fact, this  \\nwhole don’t-care phase was born out of that. But at one level, I felt so guilty.  \\nI tried again to connect with her after college. But she had a problem with  \\neverything—my thinking, my friends, my boyfriend.’\\nThe last word caught my attention. I had to speak, even though only  \\nfifty-seven breaths had passed.\\n‘Sorry, but did you say boyfriend?’\\n‘Well yeah. She knows I’m with you. And she had this thing about me  \\nfinding someone settled.’\\nSettled? The words rewound and repeated itself in my head several  \\ntimes.  What does that mean anyway ? Just someone rich, or someone who  \\ngets predictable cash flows at the end of every month. Except parents do not  \\nsay  it  that  way  because  then  it  really  sounds  like  they’re  trading  their  \\ndaughter to the highest bidder. But in some ways, they are. They do not give  \\na damn about love or feelings or crap like that. ‘Show me the money and keep  \\nour daughter for the rest of your life.’ That is the arrangement in an arranged  \\nmarriage.\\n‘What are you thinking about?’ she said.\\n‘I’m a loser according to your mom, isn’t it?’ I said.\\n‘That is not what I said.’\\n‘Don’t you bring up Bakshi and my promotion every time we have a  \\nconversation/’ I said, moving away.\\n‘Why do you get so defensive? Anyway, if Bakshi doesn’t promote you,  \\nyou can look for another job.’‘I’m tired of job hunting. There is nothing good out there. And I’m tired  \\nof rejections. Moreover, what is the point of joining another call center? I’ll  \\njust have to start as a junior agent all over again—without you, without my  \\nfriends. And let me tell you this, I may not be team leader, but I am happy I  \\nam content. You realize that? And tell your drama queen mom to come say it  \\nto my face that I am a loser. And she can send you off with whichever fucking  \\nsettled annuity income earner she likes. I am what I am...’ I said, my face  \\nbeetroot-red.\\n‘Shyam, please can you try and understand?’\\n‘Understand what? Your mother? No, I can’t. And you can’t either, but I  \\nsuspect deep down you might agree with her. Like, what am I doing with this  \\nloser,’ I said.\\n‘Stop talking nonsense,’ Priyanka shouted. ‘I just made love to you for  \\ngod’s sake. And stop using that loser word; she said and broke into tears  \\nagain.\\nTwo brief knocks on the window disturbed our conversation. It was  \\nVroom; Esha was standing next to him.\\n‘Hello? I thought we came together. You love birds are inseparable, eh?’  \\nhe said.#13\\nThe loud ring of the landline telephone brought me back from 32nd  \\nMilestone. Priyanka grabbed the phone. ‘Hiiii Ganesh,’ she said, her stretched  \\ntone too flirty, if you ask me. But then, who the hell cares for my opinion  \\nanyway.\\nI wondered what  his  tone like. ’Get under the table. Tap the phone.  \\nShyam,’  a  voice  told  me.  I  immediately  scolded  myself  for  the  horrible  \\nthought.\\n‘Of course I knew it was you. No one else calls on this emergency line,’  \\nPriyanka said and ran her fingers through her hair. Women playing with their  \\nhair while talking to a guy is an automatic female preening gesture; I saw it  \\nonce on Discovery Channel.\\n‘Yeah,’ Priyanka said after a few seconds, ‘I like cars. Which one are  \\nyou planning to buy?...Lexus?\\n‘Lexus! The dude is buying a Lexus,’ Vroom screamed, loud enough for  \\nme to understand that this was an expensive car. \\n‘Ask him which model, ask him please,’ Vroom said and Priyanka looked  \\nat him startled. She shook her head at Vroom.\\n‘Let them talk, Vroom. They’re got better things to discuss than car  \\nmodels, ’Esha said.\\n‘What colour? C’mon it’s your car. How can I decide for you?’ Priyanka  \\nsaid as her fingers started playing with the curled telephone wire. Over the  \\nnext five minutes Ganesh did most of the talking, while Priyanka kept saying  \\nmonosyllabic ‘yes’ or equivalents.\\n‘Tap the phone ,’ the voice kept banging in my head. I hated myself for  \\nit, but I knew I would to do it. I wondered when Priyanka would step away  \\nfrom the desk.\\n‘No, no, Ganesh, it’s fine, go for your meeting. I’m here only, call me  \\nlater,’ Priyanka said as she ended her call. I guess Mr Microsoft did have some  \\nwork to do after all.\\n‘Vroom is Lexus a nice car?’ Priyanka said.\\nVroom was already on the Net, surfing Lexus pictures. He turned his  \\nmonitor to Priyanka. ‘Check this out. Lexus is one of the coolest cars. The guy  \\nmust be loaded.’\\nPriyanka looked at Vroom’s screen for a few seconds and then turned to  \\nthe girls. ‘He wants me to choose the colour. Can you believe that? I don’t  \\nthink I should though,’ she said.\\nVroom pushed himself back in his swivel chair. ‘Go for black or silver.  \\nNothing is s cool as the classic colors. But I’ll check our some more for you,’  \\nhe said. ‘And tell him the interiors have to be dark leather.’\\nMeanwhile,  my  interiors  were  on  fire.  I  felt  like  throwing  up.  I  \\nwondered when I could tap the phone. It was totally wrong, and Priyanka and  \\nthe rest of the girls would probably kill me if they found out. But I had to do  it. It was masochistic, but I just had to hear that ass my ex-girlfriend away  \\nwith the promise of expensive cars.\\nI tried to set the stage so I had some excuse to get beneath the table.\\nWhy have there been no calls in the last ten minutes?’ I said. ‘I should  \\ncheck of the connections are fine.’\\n‘Let it be,’ Esha said. I’m enjoying the break.’\\n‘Yes me too,’ Radhika said. ‘And the connection is okay. Bangalore is  \\njust over-eager and picking up all the calls.’\\n‘Bio?’ Priyanka said to Esha it was their code word to go the toilet  \\ntogether for a private conversation.\\n‘Sure.’ Esha sensed the need for gossip and got up from her chair.\\n‘I’ll come too,’ Radhika said and stood up. She turned to me: ‘The girls  \\nwant a bio break, team leader.’\\n‘You’re  all going?’  I  said,  pretending  to  be  reluctant,  but  secretly  \\nthrilled. This was my chance. ‘Well, okay, since nothing much is happening  \\nright now.’\\nAs soon as the girls were out of sight I dived under the table \\n‘What are you doing?’ Vroom said.\\n‘Nothing. I don’t think the connections are firm,’ I said.\\n‘And what the hell do you know about the connections,’ Vroom said. He  \\nbent down to look under the table. ‘Tell me honestly what you’re doing.’\\nI  told  him  about  my  uncontrollable  urge  to  tap  the  phone.  Vroom  \\nscolded me for five seconds, but then got excited by the challenge and joined  \\nme under the table.\\n‘I can’t believe I’m helping you with this. The girls will kill us if they  \\nfind out,’ Vroom said.\\n‘They won’t have a clue,’ I said, and connected the wires. ‘Look, it’s  \\nalmost done.’\\nVroom picked up the landline and we tested the arrangement. I could  \\nselect an option on my computer and listen in on the landline via my headset.  \\nMr Microsoft was in the bag.\\n‘Why are you doing this?’ Vroom said.\\n‘I don’t know. Don’t ask me that.’\\n‘And why are the girls talking so long?’\\n‘You know them, they have their girl talk in the toilet.’\\n‘And you don’t want to hear what they’re saying? I’m sure they’re  \\ndiscussing Mr Microsoft there.’\\n‘Oh no,’ I said, worried about what I could be missing. ‘Although how  \\nwould we be able to eavesdrop?’\\n‘From the corner stall of the men’s toilet,’ Vroom said. ‘it shares a wall  \\nwith the girl’s toilet. If you press your ear hard against the wall, you can hear  \\nthem.’\\n‘Really?’ I said, my eyes lighting up.\\nVroom nodded.‘It’ll be wrong though, eavesdropping through a stall,’ I said.\\n‘Yes it will.’\\n‘But who cares. Let’s go,’ I said and Vroom and I jumped off our chairs.\\nVroom and I squeezed in and bolted the door in the corner stall of the  \\nWASG  men’s  toilet.  We  pressed  our  ears  against  the  wall.  I  could  hear  \\nRadhika’s voice.\\n‘Yes, he sounds like a really nice guy,’ she was saying.\\n‘But  I  shouldn’t  tell  him  the  color,  no?’  it’s  his  car  and  it  is  so  \\nexpensive. But you know what he said>’ Priyanka said.\\n‘What? Radhika said.\\n‘He said “no, it is our car”, and then he said “you have brought colour  \\nto my life, so you get to choose the color”.’\\n‘Oh, he sounds so romantic,’ Esha said.\\n‘That is such a lame loser line. Color of my life, my ass,’ I said to Vroom.\\n‘Shh. They’ll hear us, stupid. Keep quiet,’ Vroom said and put his hand  \\non my mouth.\\n‘Anyway, how’s Anuj?’ Priyanka said. I could hear the jingle of her  \\nbangles. She was probably brushing her hair.\\n‘Anuj is fine,’ Radhika said. ‘He is at a dealer conference in Kolkata. I  \\nthink he has to be up late as some dealers can’t seem to have enough to  \\ndrink.’\\n‘Sales jobs are tough,’ Esha  said. ‘Okay,  excuse me, but I have to  \\nchange this…ouch!’\\n‘What’s happening?’ I said\\nVroom shrugged his shoulders.\\n‘Esha,  your wound  has not healed  for days.  Just a  band-aid  is not  \\nenough,’ Priyanka said. I guessed Esha was changing the band-aid on her shin.\\n‘No, I’m fine. As long as it heals before the Lakme fashion week,’ Esha  \\nsaid.\\n‘Let’s go back girls, it is almost 1:00 a.m.,’ Radhika said. ‘Otherwise the  \\nboys will grumble.’\\n‘The boys always grumble. Like they never have their cigarette breaks,’  \\nEsha said.\\n‘But today they are extra grumbly. At least someone is,’ Radhika said.\\nVroom pointed a finger at me. Yes, the girls were talking about me.\\nI grumbled in lip sync.\\n‘You think Shyam is not taking the news well?’ Priyanka said her voice  \\nbecoming fainter as they walked towards the toilet’s exit.\\n‘You tell us. You know him better than we do,’ Esha said. \\n‘I wish I knew him now. I don’t know why he sulks and acts so childish  \\nsometimes,’ Priyanka said as they left the toilet.\\n‘Childish? Me? I am childish?’ I said to Vroom, jumping up and down in  \\nthe stall. ‘What the hell. Mr Microsoft gives these cheesy lines and he is cute  \\nand romantic. I say nothing and I am childish,’ I banged a fist on the stall door.‘Shyam, don’t behave like a kid,’ Vroom said.\\nWe came out of the stall. I jumped back a step as I saw Bakshi by the  \\nsink\\nThrough the mirror, Bakshi saw both of us. His jaw dropped as he  \\nturned towards us.\\n‘Hello Sir,’ Vroom said and went up to the sink next to him.\\n‘Sir, it is not what you think…’I said, pointing back at the stall.\\n‘I am not thinking anything. What you do in your personal lives is up to  \\nyou. But why aren’t you at the desk?’ Bakshi said.\\n‘Sir, we just took a short break. Call traffic is very low today,’ I said.\\n‘Did you log your break? The girls are missing from the bay as well,’  \\nBakshi said. His face was turning from a shiny pink to a shiny red.\\n‘Really? Where did the girls go/’ Vroom said.\\nBakshi turned away from us and walked to the urinal stalls. I went to the  \\nstall adjacent to him.\\n‘Didn’t you just use the toilet?’ Bakshi said.\\n‘Sir,’ I said and hesitated. ‘Sir, that was different, with Vroom.’ \\n‘Please. I don’t want to know,’ Bakshi said.\\n‘Sir, no,’ I said.\\nNow this is something women never have to deal with; standing next to  \\nyour  boss  in  the  toilet  as  he  pees  is  one  of  the  world’s  most  awkward  \\nsituations.  What  are  you  supposed  to  do?  Leave  him  alone  or  give  him  \\ncompany and entertain him? Is it okay to talk to him while he is doing his  \\nbusiness or not?\\n‘Sir, how come you are using this restroom?’ I said, as I had not seen  \\nhim there before.\\n‘Didn’t  mean  to.  I  always  use  the  executive  toilet,’  Bakshi  said,  \\nemphasizing his superior position to me.\\n‘Yes  sir,’  I  said  and  nodded  my  head.  I  had  acknowledge  his  \\nmagnanimous gesture of peeing in the same bay as us. But why was he here ?\\n‘Anyway, I came to your desk to drop off a courier for Esha.’ \\n‘Courier/’ Vroom said from his position at the sink. ‘At this time?’\\n‘I’ve kept the parcel on her desk. Just tell her,’ Bakshi said as he zipped  \\nup.\\n‘Also, Shyam, can you tell the voice agents to come to my office for a  \\nteam meeting later, say 2:30 a.m., okay/’ Bakshi said.\\n‘What’s up sir?’ Vroom said.’\\n‘Nothing. I want to share some pertinent insights with the resources.  \\nAnyway, can I ask you a couple of questions on the website? You know it well,  \\nright?’\\n‘Yes sir. And most questions will be answered in the FAQ section of the  \\nuser manual we sent you,’ Vroom said.\\n‘FAQ?\\n‘Frequently asked questions.’‘Good. Boston may have some questions. I will rely on you smart people  \\nto answer them. For instance, how do you update the site for new computer  \\nmodels?’\\n‘It’s easy, Sir. Any systems person can modify the website backend and  \\nchange the queries to suit the model,’ Vroom said.\\nBakshi asked us a few more questions. They were simple enough for  \\nVroom or me to answer them. Especially as we had built the website from  \\nscratch. \\n‘Good, good. I am impressed by your knowledge. Anyway, thanks for the  \\nuser manual, I have already sent it to Boston,’ Bakshi said and shook his hands  \\ndry. I moved away to avoid any droplets failing on me.\\n‘You did/’ both of us said in unison.\\n‘Sir, if you could have copied us on the email…we would like to be in  \\nthe loop,’ Vroom said. Good one, he was using Bakshi’s phrases back at him.\\n‘Oh, I didn’t? I am so sorry. I am not good with emails anyway. I’ll just  \\nforward it to you. But you guys man the bay now, okay?’\\n‘Of course, Sir,’ I said.\\n‘And have you finished the ad-hoc task I gave you,’ Bakshi said.\\n‘What, Sir?’ I said, and then realized he meant the photocopying of the  \\nboard meeting invite. ‘Almost done, Sir. I will send it to you.’\\nBakshi nodded and left us behind in the restroom. I felt weird that  \\nBakshi had not copied us on the email sending out the website proposal.  \\nHowever, it did not surprise me.\\n‘Is he a total moron or what? Can’t cc people on an email?’ Vroom said.\\n‘Easy man. Let’s get back to the bay,’ I said.#14\\nWe returned from the men’s room. Call flow had resumed at the WASG.  \\nRadhika  explained to a caller how to open his vacuum cleaner. Priyanka  \\nadvised a lady not to put hot pans in the dishwasher. Esha taught an old man  \\nto pre-heat an oven and simultaneously dodged his telephonic ‘your-voice-is-\\nso-sexy’ pass.\\nAnother call flashed on my screen.\\n‘I know this guy. Can I take this call?’ Vroom said.\\n‘Who is it?’ I raised my eyebrows.\\n‘A prick called William Fox. Listen in if you want,’ Vroom said.\\nI selected the option on my computer.\\n‘Good afternoon, Western Appliances, Victor speaking. Ho may I help  \\nyou today, Mr Fox,’ Vroom said.\\n‘You bloody well help me smart ass,’ the man on the phone said. He had  \\na rough voice, with a heavy southern American accent; he sounded like he  \\nwas in his mid-thirties. I could guess he was drunk.\\n‘Who is he,’ I whispered, but Vroom shushed me.\\n‘Sir, if I may confirm, I am speaking to Mr William Fox?’\\n‘You bet you are. You think just ‘cos you know my name it’s okay to sell  \\nme crap hoovers?’\\n‘What is the problem with your vacuum cleaner, Sir? It’s a VX-100?’\\n‘’Sir, do you remember when you last changed the dust bags?’ Vroom  \\nsaid.\\n‘Like fuck I remember when you last changed the dust bags. It’s just a  \\ncrap machine you dumbass.’\\nVroom took three deep breaths. He remembered the suggested line in  \\nsuch a situation. ‘Sir, I request you to not use that language.’\\n‘Oh really? Then make your fucking hoover work.’\\nVroom pressed a button on his phone before he spoke again.\\n‘Fuck you first you sonofabitch prickhead…’ he said.\\n‘What are you doing?’ I said, panicking.\\n‘Just venting, don’t worry it is on mute,’ Vroom smirked. ‘Back to  \\nnormal now.’ He pressed the button again and, trying his best to keep his  \\ntone calm, said, Sir, you need to change the dust bags when they are full.’\\n‘Who am I speaking to?’ the voice on the phone became agitated.\\n‘Victor, sir.’\\n‘Tell me your fucking name. You’re some kid in India, isn’t it?’\\n‘Sir, I am afraid I can’t disclose my location.’\\n‘You’re from India. Tell m, boy.’\\n‘Yes sir. I am in India,’ Vroom gave in.\\n‘So what did you have to do to get this job? Fucking degree in nuclear  \\nphysics?’\\n‘Sir, do you need help with your cleaner or not?’ Vroom said. ‘C’mon son, answer me. I don’t need your help. Yeah, I’ll change the  \\ndust bag. What about you guys? When will you change your dusty country?’\\n‘Excuse me, sir, but I want you to stop talking like that,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Oh really, now some brown kid will tell me what to do— William Fox’s  \\nvoice stopped abruptly as I cut off the call.\\nVroom didn’t move for a few seconds. His whole body trembled and he  \\nwas breathing heavily. Then he placed his elbows on the table and covered his  \\nface with his hands.\\n‘You don’t have to talk to those people. You know that,’ I said to  \\nVroom.\\nThe girls glanced at us while still on their calls.\\n‘Vroom, I’m talking to you,’ I said.\\nHe raised his face and slowly turned to loot at me. Then he banged a fist  \\non the table. ‘Damn,’ he screamed and kicked hard under the table.\\n‘What the...’ Priyanka said. ‘Mt call just got cut.’\\nVroom’s kick had dislodged the power wires, disconnecting all our calls.  \\nI wanted to check the wires, but had to check on Vroom first. Vroom stood up  \\nand his six-foot-plus frame towered above us.\\n‘Guys, there are two things I cannot stand,’ he said and showed us two  \\nfingers. ‘Racists. And Americans.’\\nPriyanka started laughing.\\n‘What is there to laugh?’ I said.\\n‘because there is a contradiction. Doesn’t like racists, but can’t stand  \\nAmericans,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Why?’ Vroom said, ignoring Priyanka. ‘Why do some fat-ass, dim-witted  \\nAmericans get to act superior to us? Do you know why?’ \\n‘Nobody answered.\\nVroom continued, ‘I’ll tell you why. Not because they are smarter. Not  \\nbecause they are better people. But because their country is rich and ours is  \\npoor. That is the only damn reason. Because is rich and ours is poor. That is  \\nthe only damn reason. Because the losers who have run our country for the  \\nlast  fifty  years  couldn’t  do  better  than  make  India  one  of  the  poorest  \\ncountries on earth. Great job, thank you, dear great fucking leaders.’ \\n‘Stop overreacting Vroom. Some stupid guy calls and…’ Radhika said.\\n‘Screw Americans,’ I said and gave him a bottle of water. ‘Look, you’ve  \\nbroken down the entire system.’ I pointed to the black call screens.\\n‘Someone kicked the Americans a bit too hard. No more calls for now,’  \\nPriyanka said, rolling her eyes.\\n‘Let me take a look,’ I said and went under the table. I was more  \\nworried about the wires tapping the emergency phone. However, they were  \\nintact.\\n‘Shyam, wait,’ Esha said ‘w have a great excuse for not taking calls. Let  \\nit be for a while.’\\nEveryone agreed with her. We decided to call systems after twenty  \\nminutes.‘Why was Bakshi here? I saw him come out of the men’s toilet,’ Priyanka  \\nsaid.\\n‘To deliver a courier for Esha,’ I said. ‘And he said there is a team  \\nmeeting at 2:30 a.m. Oh man, I still have to Xerox the board meeting invite.’\\nI assembled Bakshi’s sheets again.\\n‘What courier,’ Esha said. ‘This?’\\nShe lifted a brown packet that was lying near her computer.\\n‘Must  be,’  Vroom  said,  ‘though  which  courier  delivers  stuff  at  this  \\ntime?’\\nEsha opened the packet. She took out two bundles of hundred rupee  \\nnotes. One bundle had a small yellow post-it note on it. She read the post-it  \\nand her face went pale.\\n‘Wow, someone’s rich,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Not bad. What’s the money for?’ Radhika said.\\n‘It’s nothing. Just a friend returning money she borrowed from me,’  \\nEsha said.\\nShe dumped the packet in her drawer and took out her mobile phone.  \\nHer face was pensive, as if she was debating whether or not to make a call. I  \\ncollected my sheets to go to the Xerox room.\\n‘Want to help?’ I called out to Vroom.\\n‘No thanks. People I worked with are becoming national TV reporters,  \\nbut look at me. Taking calls from losers and being asked to help with loser  \\njobs,’ Vroom said and looked away from me.#15\\nI switched on the Xerox machine in the supplies room and put Bakshi’s  \\nstack in the document feeder. I had just pressed the ‘start’ button on the  \\nagenda document when the copier creaked and groaned to a halt. ‘Paper Jam:  \\nTray 2’ appeared in big, bold letters on the screen.\\nThe copier in our supplies room is not a machine. It is a person. A  \\nperson with a psychotic soul and a grumpy attitude towards life. Whenever  \\nyou copy more than two sheets, there is paper jam. After that, the machine  \\nteases you: it gives you systematic instructions on how to un-jam it— open \\ncover, remove tray, pull lever . Now if it knows this much, why doesn’t it fix  \\nitself?\\n‘Damn,’ I mumbled to myself as I bent down to open the paper trays. I  \\nturned a few levers, and pulled out whatever paper was in sight.\\nI stood up and rearranged the documents on the feeder tray. I pressed  \\n‘start’  again,  not  realizing  that  my  ID  was  resting  on  Bakshi’s  original  \\ndocument. as the machine re-started, it sucked in the ID along with the  \\npaper. The ID pulled at my strap, which tightened around my neck.\\n‘Aaarg,’ I said as I chocked. The ID went inside the machine’s guts, and  \\nthe strap curled tighter around my neck. I screamed loudly and pulled at my  \\nID. However, the machine had more strength. I was sure it wanted to kill me—\\nand probably making a copy of my ID for my obituary while it was as it. I  \\nstarted kicking the machine hard.\\nVroom  came  running  into  the  room.  ‘What  the…’  he  appeared  \\nnonplussed. He saw A4 sheets spread all over the room, a groaning Xerox  \\nmachine, and me lying down on top of the photocopiers, desperately tugging  \\nat my strap.\\n‘Do something,‘ I said in a muffled voice.\\n‘Like what?’ he said and bent over to look at the machine. The screen  \\nwas flashing the poetic words ‘Paper Jam’. My ID strap ran right into the  \\nmachine.\\nVroom looked around the supplies room and found a pair of scissors.\\n‘Should I?’ he said and smiled at me. ‘I really want the others to see  \\nthis.’\\n‘Shut…up…and…cut,’ I said.\\nSnap! In one snap, my breath came back.\\n‘Okay now?’ Vroom asked as he threw the scissors back in the supplies  \\ntray.\\nI nodded as I rubbed my neck and took wheezing breaths. I rested my  \\nhead down on the warm, soothing glass of the photocopy machine. I must  \\nhave rested it too hard, or maybe my head is too heavy. I heard a crack.\\n‘Fuck,’ Vroom said, ‘you broke the glass.’\\n‘What?’ I said as I lifted my head.\\n‘Get off,’ Vroom said and pulled me off the machine. ‘What is with you  \\nman?’ having a bad office supplies day?’‘Who knows?’ I said, collecting Bakshi’s document. ‘I really am good for  \\nnothing. Cannot even do these loser jobs. I almost died. Can you imagine the  \\nheadline—“Copied decapitates man, duplicates document”.’\\nVroom laughed and put his arm around my shoulder.\\n‘Don’t take tension dude. And I apologize.’\\n‘For what,’ I said. Nobody has ever apologized to me in the past twenty-\\nsix years of my life.\\n‘I’m sorry I was rude and didn’t come and help you. First these rumors  \\nabout the call center closing down. Then Boontoo makes it to NDTV. And  \\nBakshi  sends  the  document  without  copying  us.  Meanwhile,  some  psycho  \\ncaller screams curses at me. Just gets to you sometimes.’\\n‘What gets to you?’ I asked. I was trying t copy Bakshi’s document again,  \\nbut the Xerox machine was hurling abusive message on the screen every time  \\nI pressed a button. Soon it self-detected a crack in the glass and switched  \\nitself off. I think a committed suicide.\\n‘Life,’ Vroom said, sitting down on one of the stools in the supplies  \\nroom, ‘life gets to you. You think you are perfectly happy—you know, good  \\nsalary, nice friends, life is a party—but all of a sudden, in one little snap,  \\neverything can crack, like this stupid glass pane of the Xerox machine.’\\nI did not fully understand Vroom’s glass pane theory of life, but his face  \\ntold me he was upset. I decided to soothe the man who had just saved my life.\\n‘Vroom, you know what your problem is?’\\n‘What?’\\n‘You don’t have real love in your life. You need to fall in love, be in love  \\nand stay in love. That is the gap you are facing,’ I said firmly, as if I really  \\nknew what I was talking about.\\n‘You think so?’ Vroom said. ‘I’ve had girlfriends. I’ll make another one  \\nsoon—you know that.’\\n‘Not those kind of girls. Someone you really care about. And I think we  \\nall know who that is.’\\n‘Esha?’ he said.\\nI kept quiet.\\n‘Esha is not interested. I have asked her. She has her modeling and says  \\nshe has no time for a relationship. Besides, she has other issues with me,’  \\nVroom said.\\n‘What issues?’ I said.\\n‘She says I don’t know what love is. I care for cars and bikes more than  \\ngirls.’\\nI laughed. ‘You do.’\\n‘That is such an unfair comparison. It’s like asking women that they care  \\nfor more, nice shoes or men. There is no easy answer.’\\n‘Really? So we are benchmarked to footwear?’\\n‘Trust me, women can ignore men for sexy shoes. But come to the point\\n—Esha.’\\n‘Do you think you love her?’ I said.\\n‘Can’t say. But I’ve felt something for her over a year now.’‘But you dated other girls last year.’\\n‘Those girls were never important. They were like TV channels you surf  \\nwhile looking for the real program you want to see. You are with that Curly  \\nWurly chick, and you still have feelings for Priyanka,’ Vroom said.\\nThe statement startled me.\\n‘Shefali is there to help me move on,’ I said.\\n‘Screw moving on. That chick can put you off women forever. Maybe  \\nthat will help you get over Priyanka,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Don’t change the topic. We’re talking about you. I think you should ask  \\nEsha again for a real relationship. Do it man.’\\nVroom looked at me for a few seconds. ‘Will you help me?’ he said.\\n‘Me? You’re the expert with girls,’ I said.\\n‘This one is different. The stakes are higher. Can you be around when I  \\ntalk to her? Just listen to our conversation. Maybe we can analyze it later.’\\n‘Okay, sure. So, let’s do it now.’\\n‘Now?’\\n‘Why not? We have free time. Afterwards calls will, begin and we’ll be  \\nbusy again. Worst case, management may fire us. Better act fast right?’ I said.\\n‘Okay. Where do we do it?’ Vroom said as he put his hand  on his  \\nforehead to think. ‘The dining room?’\\nThe dinning room made sense. I could be nearby, but inconspicuous. #16\\n‘Everything okay? I heard noises,’ Esha said, as we returned from the  \\nsupplies room. She stretched back on her chair. Her top slid up and the navel  \\nring twinkled.\\n‘The Xerox machine died. Anyway, anyone for a snack?’ I said.\\n‘Yes, let’s go. I need a walk. Come, Priyanka,’ Esha said and tried to pull  \\nPriyanka up by her upper arm.\\n‘No, I’ll stay here,’ Priyanka said and smiled. ‘Ganesh might call.’\\nA scoop of hot molten lead entered through my head and left my toes.  \\nTry to move on , I reminded myself. At the same time, I had the urge to pick  \\nup that landline and smash it to fifty pieces.\\nRadhika was about to get up when I stopped her.\\n‘Actually Radhika, can you stay back? If Bakshi walks by, at least he’ll  \\nsee some people on the desk,’ I said.\\nRadhika sat back puzzled as we left the room.\\nThe dining area \\nThe dinning area at Connexions is a cross between a restaurant and a  \\ncollege hostel mess. There are three rows of long granite-covered tables, with  \\nseating on both sides. The chairs are plush; they’re upholstered in black  \\nleather in an attempt to give them a hip designer look. The tables have a  \\nsmall vase every three feet. Management recently renovated the place when  \\nsome overpriced consulting l of MBAs) recommended that a bright dining room  \\nwould be good for employee motivation. A much cheaper option would have  \\njust been to fire. Bakshi, if you ask me.\\nVroom took a cheese sandwich and chips (we don’t serve Indian food—\\nagain for motivation reasons) in his tray and sat at one of the tables. Esha just  \\ntool soda water and sat opposite Vroom. I think slice of eats once every three  \\ndays. I took an unhealthy sized slice of chocolate cake. I shouldn’t have, but  \\njustified it as a well-deserved reward for helping a friend.\\nI sat at the adjacent table, took out my phone, and started typing fake  \\nSMS messages.\\n‘Why isn’t Shyam sitting with us?’ Esha said t Vroom, twisting on her  \\nseat to look at me.\\n‘Private SMSing,’ Vroom said. Esha rolled her eyes and nodded.\\n‘Actually Esha, I wanted to tell you something,’ Vroom said, fingering  \\nthe chips on his plate. I had already finished half my cake. I was probably a  \\npig with a reverse eating disorder in my previous life.\\n‘Yeah/’ Esha said to Vroom, dragging the word as an eyebrow rose in  \\nsuspicion. The invisible female antennae were out and suggesting caution.  \\n‘Talk about what?’\\n‘Esha,’ Vroom said, clearing his throat. ‘I’ve been thinking about you a  \\nlot lately.’\\n‘Really?’ she said and looked sideways to see if I was eavesdropping. Of  \\ncourse I was, but I made an extra effort to display a facial expression that  showed I was really focusing on my cake. She watched as I joyfully consumed  \\nwhat was probably her weekly calorific consumption in a few seconds.\\n‘Yes really, Esha. I may have met a lot of girls, but no one is like you.’\\nShe giggled and, taking a flower out from the vase, began plucking out  \\nits petals.\\n‘Yes,’ Vroom continued, ‘and I think rather than fool around, could do  \\nwith a real relationship. So, I’m asking you again—will you go out with me?’\\nEsha was quiet for a few minutes. ‘What do you expect me to say?’\\n‘I don’t know. How about a yes?’\\n‘Really/ well unfortunately that word did not occur to me,’ Esha said,  \\nher expression serious.\\n‘Why?’ Vroom said. I could tell he though it was over already. He had  \\ntold me once, if a girl hints she is not interested, it’s time to cut losses and  \\nquit. Never try the persuasion game.\\n‘I’ve told you before. I have to focus on my modeling career. I can’t  \\nafford the luxury of making a boyfriend,’ she said, her voice unusually cold.\\n‘What is with you, Esha? Don’t you want someone to support you…’  \\nVroom said.\\n‘that’s right, with three different girlfriends last year, I am sure you will  \\nalways be there for me,’ Esha said.\\n‘The other girls were just for fun. They meant nothing, they’re like  \\npizza  or  movies  or  something.  They  are  channel  surfing,  you  are  more  \\nserious,’ Vroom said.\\n‘So what serious channel am I? The BCC?’ Esha said.\\n‘I have known you for more than a year. We have spent hundreds of  \\nnights together…’\\nI  though  Vroom’s  last  phrase  came  out  odd,  but  Esha  was  too  \\npreoccupied to notice.\\n‘Just drop it, Vroom,’ Esha said put the flowers back in the vase. Her  \\nvoice was breaking, though she was not crying yet.\\n‘Are you okay?’ Vroom said and extended his hand to hold hers. She  \\nsensed the move and pulled her hand away nanoseconds before he reached it.\\n‘Not really,’ Esha said.\\n‘I thought we were friends. I just wanted to take it to the next level…’  \\nVroom said.\\n‘Please stop it,’ Esha said, and covered her eyes with her hands. ‘You  \\nchose the worst time to talk about this.’\\n‘What’s wrong Esha? Can I help?’ Vroom said, his voice now held more  \\nconcern than the nervousness of romance.\\nShe shook her head frantically.\\nI knew Vroom had failed miserably. This girl was not interested and was  \\nin a strange mood tonight anyway. I finished my thousand-calorie chocolate  \\ncake, and went to the counter to get water. By the time I returned, they had  \\nleft the dining room.\\n#17I returned to the WASG bay with the taste of chocolate cake lingering in  \\nmy mouth. I  sat  down at my  desk  and  began  surfing irrelevant website.  \\nRadhika was giving Priyanka recommendation on the best shops in Delhi for  \\nbridal dresses. Esha and Vroom were silent. My guilt for eating the chocolate  \\ncake combined with my guilt for not reporting the systems failure. When guilt  \\ncombines, it multiplies manifold. I finally called IT to fix our desk. They were  \\nbusy, but promised to come in ten minutes.\\nThe spare landline’s ring startled us all.\\n‘Ganesh,’ Priyanka said as she scrambled to pick up the phone. I kept a  \\ncalm face while I selected the option to listen in on the call.\\n‘Mom,’ Priyanka said, ‘why aren’t you sleeping? Who gave you this  \\nnumber?’\\n‘What sleeping? No one has slept a wink today,’ her mother said in an  \\nexcited voice. I had never met her. However, through Priyanka’s stories, I felt  \\nI knew her intimately.\\nThe tapped line had exceptional clarity. Her mother sounded elated,  \\nwhich was unusual for a woman who (according to Priyanka) had spent most  \\nof life in self-imposed, obsessive-compulsive depression.\\nPriyanka’s mother explained how Ganesh had just called her and given  \\nher the emergency line number. Ganesh’s family in India had also not slept;  \\nthey had been calling Priyanka’s parents at least once an hour. Ganesh had  \\ntold Priyanka’s family that he was ‘on top of the world’. I guess the sad dude  \\nreally had no other life.\\n‘I am so happy today. Look how God sent such a perfect match right to  \\nour door. And I used to worry about you so much,’ Priyanka’s mother said.\\nThat’s great mom, but what’s up?’ Priyanka said. I’ll be home in a few  \\nhours. How come you called her?’\\n‘Just like that. Can’t a mother call her daughter?’ Priyanka’s mom said.  \\n‘Can’t a mother’ is one of her classic lines.\\n‘No mom, I just wondered. Anyway, Ganesh and I spoke a few times  \\ntoday.’\\n‘And?’\\n‘And what?’\\n‘Did he tell you his plans?’\\n‘What plans/’\\n‘He is coming to India next month. Originally he’d planned the trip so he  \\ncould see girls. But now that he has made his choice, he wants to get married  \\non  that  trip,’  Priyanka’s  mom  said,  her  voice  turning  breathless  with  \\nexcitement.\\n‘What?’ Priyanka said, ‘next month/’ and looked around a all of us with  \\na shocked expression. Everyone returned puzzled looks, as they did not know  \\nwhat was going on. Of course, I also pretended to look confused.\\n‘Mom, no!’ Priyanka wailed. ‘How can I get married next month? That is  \\nless than five weeks.’‘Oh  you  don’t  have  to  worry  about  that.  I  am  there  to  organize  \\neverything. You wait and see, I will work day and night to make it a grand  \\nevent.’\\n‘Mom I’m not worried about organizing a party. I have so be ready to get  \\nmarried.  I  hardly  know  Ganesh,’  Priyanka  said,  entwining  her  fingers  \\nnervously in the telephone wire.\\n‘Huh?’ Of course, you are ready for it. When the families have fixed the  \\nmatch, bride and groom are happy, why delay? And the boy can’t come again  \\nand again. He is in an important position after all.’\\nYeah right, I thought. He was probably one of the thousands of Indian  \\ngeeks coding away in Microsoft. $But to his in-laws, he was Mr Bill Gates  \\nhimself.\\n‘Mom, please. I cannot do it next month. Sorry—but no,’ Priyanka said,  \\n‘and I have to keep the phone down now.’\\n‘What do you mean no? This is too much. You have to disagree with me  \\nalways or what/’\\n‘Mom, how does this have anything to do with disagreeing with you?’ in  \\nfact, how does it have anything to do with you? It is my life, and sorry, I can’t  \\nmarry anyone I have only known for five weeks.’\\nPriyanka’s  mother  stayed  silent  for  a  while.  I  thought  she  would  \\nretaliate, but then I figured out: this silence was working more effectively  \\nthan  words.  She  knows  how  to  put  an  emotional  stasher  knife  tight  at  \\nPriyanka’s neck.\\n‘Mom, are you there?’ Priyanka asked after ten seconds.\\n‘Yes, I am still here. Will be dead soon, but unfortunately still here.’\\n‘Mom c’mon now…’\\n‘Don’t even make me happy by mistake,’ Priyanka’s mother said. What  \\na killer line, I thought. I almost applauded. \\nPriyanka threw a hand up in the air in exasperation. She grabbed a  \\nstress ball lying near Vroom’s computer across the table and squeezed it hard.  \\nI tugged the headset closer to my ear as Priyanka’s voice turned softer.\\n‘Mom, please. Don’t do this.’\\n‘You  know  I  prayed  for  one  hour  today…praying  you  stay  happy…\\nforever,’  Priyanka’s  mother  said  as  she  broke  into  tears.  Whoever starts  \\ncrying first always has an advantage in an argument. This works for Priyanka’s  \\nmother, who at least has obedient tear glands, if not an obedient daughter.\\n‘Mom, don’t create a scene. I’m at work. What do you want from me/ I  \\nhave agreed to the boy. Now why is everyone pushing me?’\\n‘Isn’t Ganesh nice? What is the problem?’ her mother said in a tragic  \\ntone that could put any Bollywood hero’s mother to shame.\\n‘Mom, I didn’t say he isn’t nice or there is a problem. I just need time.\\n‘You aren’t distracted, are you? Are you still talking to that useless call  \\ncenter chap, what is his name…Shyam.’\\nI jumped when I heard my name.\\n‘No mom. That is over. I have told you so many times I have agreed to  \\nGanesh right?’‘So, why can’t you agree for next month—for everyone’s happiness?  \\nCan’t a mother beg her daughter for this?’\\nThere you go: ‘can’t a mother…’ number II for the night.\\nPriyanka closed her eyes to compose herself. She spoke slowly, ‘Can I  \\nthink about it?’\\n‘Of course. Think about it. But think for all of us. Not just yourself.’\\n‘Okay. I will. Just… just give me some time.’\\nPriyanka hung up the phone and kept still. The girls asked her for  \\ndetails.\\nShe looked around and threw the stress ball at her monitor.\\n‘Can you believe this? She wants me to get married next month. Next  \\nmonth!’ Priyanka said and stood up. ‘They brought me up for twenty-five  \\nyears, and they can’t wait more than twenty-five days to get rid of me. What  \\nis with these people—am I such a burden?’\\nPriyanka  repeated  her  conversation  to  Esha  and  Radhika.  Vroom  \\nchecked his computer to see if Bakshi had sent us any emails.\\n‘It doesn’t matter right? You have to marry him anyway. Why drag it  \\nout?’ Radhika said to Priyanka.\\n‘Yes,  you  get  to drive  the  Lexus  sooner  too,’  Vroom  said,  without  \\nlooking up from his screen. Screw Vroom. I gave him a firm glare out of the  \\ncorner of my eye.\\n‘What will I wear?’ Esha said. Her somber mood had lightened with the  \\nnew announcement. Give her a chance to dress up and she will ignore people  \\ndying around her. ‘This is too short a notice,’ she continued, ‘ I need a new  \\ndress for every ceremony.’\\n‘Get your  designer friends  to lend you a few dresses,’ Vroom said to  \\nEsha, with a hint of sarcasm in his voice.\\nEsha’s face dropped again. Only I saw it, but her eyes became wet. She  \\ntook a tissue from her purse. She pretended to fix her lipstick and casually  \\nwiped her tears.\\n‘I’m so not ready for this. In one month I’ll be someone’s wife. Gosh,  \\nlittle kids will call me auntie,’ Priyanka said.\\nEveryone discussed the pros and cons of Priyanka getting married in  \\nfour weeks. Most of them felt getting married so quickly wasn’t such a big  \\ndeal once she had chosen the guy. Of course, most people don’t give a damn  \\nabout me as well.\\nIn the midst of the discussion the systems guy returned to our desk.\\n‘What  happened  here?’  he  said  from  under  the  table.  ‘Looks  like  \\nsomeone ripped these wires apart.’\\n‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘See if we can get some traffic again.’\\nPriyanka’s  mother  and  her  words—‘the  useless  call  center  boy’—\\nresounded in my mind. I remembered the time when Priyanka told me her  \\nmother’s views on me. It was not long ago: it was one of our last dates at  \\nMocha Café.#18\\nMy Past Dates with \\nPriyanka—IV\\nMocha Café, Greater Kailash I\\nFive months before this night\\nWe promised to meet on one condition—we would not fight. No brain  \\ngames,  no  sarcastic  comments  and  no  judgmental  remarks.  She  was  late  \\nagain. I fiddled with the menu as I looked around me. Mocha’s décor had a  \\nMiddle Eastern twist, with hookahs, velvet cushions and colored glass lamps  \\neverywhere.  Many  of  the  tables  were  occupied  by  couples,  sitting  with  \\nintertwined fingers, obviously deeply in love. The girls laughed at whatever  \\nthe guys said. The guys ordered the most expensive items on the menu. Every  \\nnow  and  then  their eyes  needed  to be  happy  was each  other.  The silly  \\ndelusion in the initial stage of a relationship: aren’t they amazing? \\nMy life was nowhere near perfect, of course. For starters, my girlfriend,  \\nif I could still call her that, was late. Plus, I could sense she was itching to  \\ndump me. Priyanka and I had ended eight of our last ten calls with someone  \\nhanging up the phone on the other.\\nI had not slept the entire day, which is not a big deal for most people,  \\nbut considering I work all night, it had no left me feeling too good. My job was  \\ngoing nowhere, with Bakshi bent on sucking every last drop of my blood.  \\nMaybe he was right—I just did not have the strategic vision or managerial  \\nleadership or whatever crap things you are supposed to have to do well in  \\nlife. Maybe Priyanka’s mom was right too—her daughter was stuck with a  \\nloser.\\nThese  thoughts  enveloped  me  as  she  came  in.  She  had  just  had  a  \\nhaircut. Her waist-length hair was now just a few inches below her shoulders.  \\nI liked her with long hair, but she never listened to me. I told you, I didn’t  \\nhave the leadership skills to influence anyone. Anyway, her hair still looked  \\nnice. She wore a white linen top and a flowing lavender skirt with lost of  \\ncrinkly edges. She had on a thin silver necklace, with the world’s tiniest  \\ndiamond pendant handing from it. I started at my watch as a sign of protest.\\n‘Sorry, Shyam,’ she said as she put a giant brown bag on the table, ‘that  \\nass hairdresser took so long. I told him I had to leave early.’\\n‘No big deal. A haircut has to be more important than me,’ I said,  \\nwithout any emotion in my voice.\\n‘I thought we said no sarcasm,’ she said, ‘and I did say sorry.’\\n‘That’s right. Once sorry for half an hour seems fair, in fact, go get a  \\ntwo-hour facial done as well. You can come back and say sorry four times.’\\n‘Shyam, please. I know I’m late. We promised not to fight. Saturday is  \\nthe only day I get time for a haircut.’‘I told you to keep your hair long,’ I said.\\n‘I did for a long time. But it’s sop hard to maintain it, Shyam. I’m sorry,  \\nbut you need to understand sometimes. I had the most boring hair in the  \\nworld and I could do nothing with it. And it took one hour to oil the damn  \\nthing. And it feels so hot in the Delhi heat.’\\n‘Whatever,’ I said in a bored voice, looking at the menu. ‘What do you  \\nwant?’\\n‘I want my Shyam to be in a good moon,’ she said and held my hand. We  \\ndidn’t intertwine fingers though.\\n‘My’ Shyam. I guess I still count, I thought. Girls sure know how to sweet  \\ntalk.\\n‘Hmm…’ I said and let out a big sigh. If she was trying to make peace, I  \\nguess I had to do my bit. ‘We can have their special Maggi noodles.’\\n‘Maggi? You’ve come all this way to eat Maggi?’ she said, and took the  \\nmenu from me. ‘And check this out: ninety bucks for Maggi?’ she said the last  \\nphrase so loudly that the tables and a few waiters next to us heard us.\\n‘Priyanka, we earn now. We can afford it,’ I said.\\n‘Order chocolate brownies and ice cream,’ she said. ‘At least something  \\nyou don’t get at home.’\\n‘I thought you said you’ll have whatever I want,’ I said.\\n‘Yes,  but  Maggi?’  she  said  and  made  a  quirky  face.  Her  nostrils  \\ncontracted for a second. I had seen that face before, and I could not help but  \\nsmile. I saved myself time by ordering the brownie.\\nThe waiter brought the chocolate brownie and placed it in front of  \\nPriyanka. Half a liter of chocolate sauce dripping over a blob of vanilla ice  \\ncream placed precariously over a huge slice of rich chocolate cake. It was a  \\nheart attack served on a plate. Priyanka had two spoons and slid the dish  \\ntowards me.\\n‘Look at me, eating away like a cow,’ she said.\\n‘Did you have a heart to heart with your mom?’ I said.\\nPriyanka wiped her chocolate-lined lips with tissue. I felt like kissing her  \\nright  then.  However,  I  hesitated.  When  you  hesitate  in  love,  you  know  \\nsomething is wrong.\\n‘Me and my mom,’ she said, ‘are incapable of having a rational, sane  \\nconversation. I tried to talk to her—about you and my plans to study further.  \\nIt sounds like a simple conversation, right?’\\n‘What happened?’\\n‘We were crying in seven minutes. Can you believe it?’\\n‘With your mother, I can. What exactly did she say?’\\n‘You don’t want to know.’\\n‘But I have to know,’ I insisted.\\n‘She said she has never liked you. Because you are not settled, and  \\nbecause since the day I started dating you I have changed and become an  \\nunaffectionate and cold person.’ \\n‘Unaffectionate? What the…?’ I shouted, my face turning red. ‘How the  \\nhell have I changed you?The second comment cut me into thin slices. Sure, I hated the ‘not  \\nsettled’ tag too, but there was some truth to that. How could she accuse me  \\nof turning Priyanka into a cold person, though?\\nShe did not say anything. Her face softened and I heard tiny sobs. It was  \\nso unfair, I was the one being insulted: I should be the one getting to cry.  \\nHowever, I guess only girls look nice crying on dates.\\n‘Listen Priyanka, your mom is a psycho…’ I said.\\n‘No she is not. It is not because of you, but I have changed. Maybe it is  \\nbecause of my age—and she confuses it with my being with you. We used to be  \\nso close, and now she doesn’t like anything I do,’ she said and broke down  \\ninto full-on-crying. Everyone in the café must have thought I had cheated on  \\nmy girlfriend and was dumping her or something. I got some ‘you-horrible-\\nmen’ looks from girls at other tables.\\n‘Calm down, Priyanka. What does she want? And tell me honestly, what  \\ndo you want?’ I said.\\nPriyanka shook her head and remained silent.\\nIt dives me nuts. The effort it sometimes takes to make women speak up  \\nis harder than interrogating terrorists. \\n‘Please, talk to me,’ I said, looking at the brownie. The ice cream had  \\nmelted to a gooey mess.\\nShe finally spoke. ‘She wants me to show that I love her. She wants me  \\nto make her happy and marry someone she chooses for me.’\\n‘And what do you want?’ I said.\\n‘I don’t know,’ she told the tablecloth.\\nWhat the hell? I thought. All I get for four years of togetherness is an ‘I  \\ndon’t know?\\n‘You want to dump me, don’t you? I am just not good enough for your  \\nfamily.’\\n‘It isn’t like that Shyam. She married my dad who was just a government  \\nemployee only because he seemed like a decent human being. But her sisters  \\nwaited to marry better-qualified boys and they are richer today. Her concern  \\nfor me comes from there. She is my mother. It is not as if she does not know  \\nwhat is good for me. I want someone doing well in his career as well.’\\n‘So your mother is not the only cause for the strain in our relationship.  \\nIt is you as well.’\\n‘A relationship never flounders for one reason alone. There are many  \\nissues. You don’t take feedback. You are sarcastic. You don’t understand my  \\nambitions. Don’t I always tell you to focus on your career?’\\n‘Just get lost okay,’ I said.\\nMy loud voice attracted the attention of the neighboring tables. All the  \\ngirls  at  Mocha  were  probably  convinced  I  was  the  worst  possible  male  \\nchauvinist pig ever.\\nHer tears were back. However, she noticed people watching us and  \\ncomposed herself. A few wipes with a tissue and she was normal again.\\n‘Shyam,  it  is  this  attitude  of  yours.  At  home,  my  mother  doesn’t  \\nunderstand. Over here, you don’t. Why have you become like this? You have  changed Shyam, you are not the same happy person I first met,’ she, her  \\nvoice restrained out calm.\\n‘Nothing has happened to  me. It is you who finds new faults in me  \\neveryday. I have a bad boss and I am trying to manage as happily as possible.  \\nWhat has happened to you? You used to eat at truck drivers’ dhabas. Now all  \\nof a sudden you need an NRI cardiac surgeon to make ends meet?’\\nWe started at each other for two seconds.\\n‘Okay, it’s my fault. That is what you want to prove, right? I am a  \\nconfused, selfish, mean person right?’ she said.\\nI looked at her. I couldn’t believe I had loved her and those flared  \\nnostrils for four years. And now it was difficult to say four sentences without  \\ndisagreeing.\\nI sighed. ‘I thought there was to be no arguing, blaming and sarcasm.  \\nBut we have done it all.’\\n‘I care a lot for you,’ she said and held my hand.\\n‘Me too,’ I said, ‘but I think we need to take care of other things in our  \\nlife as well.’\\nWe asked for the bill and made cursory conversation about the weather,  \\ntraffic and the décor of the café. We were talking a lot, but we weren’t  \\ncommunicating at all.\\n‘Call me in the evening if you’re free,’ I said as I paid the bill and got up  \\nto leave.\\nIt had come to this: we had to tell each other to call. Previously, not a  \\nwaking hour passed without one of us SMS-ing or calling the other.\\n‘Okay, or I will SMS you,’ she said. An SMS seemed simpler than dealing  \\nwith another conversation.\\nWe did a basic hug, without really touching. A kiss was out of the  \\nquestion.\\n‘Sure,’ I said, ‘it’s always nice to get your message.’\\nSarcasm. Man, will I never learn?#19\\nMocha Café and its colored Arabian lights faded away from my mind as it  \\nreturned to WASG’s tube light-lit interiors. I checked the time: it was close to  \\n2:00 a.m. I got up to take a short walk. I did not know what was more  \\ndisgusting—thinking about Priyanka’s mother or hearing the girls obsess about  \\nPriyanka’s marriage. I went to the corner of the room where Military Uncle  \\nsat. We nodded to each other. I looked at his screen and saw pictures of  \\nanimals—chimps, rhinos, lions and deer.\\n‘Are those your customers/’ I said and laughed at my own non-funny  \\njoke.\\nMilitary Uncle smiled back. He was in one of his rare good moods.\\n‘These are pictures I took at the zero. I scanned them to send to my  \\ngrandson.’\\n‘Cool. He likes animals?’ I said and beet over to take a closer look at the  \\nchimp. It bore an uncanny resemblance to Bakshi.\\n‘Yes, I’m sending it by email to my son. But I’m having trouble as our  \\nemails do not allow more than four megabyte attachments.’\\nI decided to help Uncle, if only to avoid going back to the bay until the  \\nsystems guy had fixed the phones.\\n‘Hmm… these are large files,’ I said, as I took over his mouse. ‘I could  \\ntry to zip them—thought that won’t compress images much. The other way is  \\nto make the pictures low resolution. Otherwise, you can leave a few animals  \\nout.’\\nMilitary Uncle wanted to keep them high resolution. We agreed to leave  \\nout the deer and the hippos as those were not his grandson’s favorite animals.\\n‘Thanks so much, Shyam,’ Military Uncle said, as I successfully pressed  \\n‘send’ on his email. I looked at his face: there was genuine gratitude. It was  \\nhard to believe he had been booted out because he was too bossy with his  \\ndaughter-in-law—a piece of gossip Radhika had once passed on to me.\\n‘You’re welcome,’ I said. I noticed Vroom signal to me to come back.  \\nHoping that the topic of Priyanka’s wedding was over, I returned to the desk.\\nBakshi has sent us a copy of the proposal,’ Vroom said.\\nI sat at my desk and opened my inbox. There was a message from  \\nBakshi.\\nThe  calls  had  not  resumed;  the  systems  guy  had  gone  back  to  his  \\ndepartment again to get new wires.\\n‘Let’s see which whit e bozos he sucked up to. Who has he sent it to?’  \\nVroom’s voice was excited.\\nI opened the mail to see who had been the original recipients. It was the  \\nwho’s  who  of  Western  Computers  and  Appliances  in  Boston:  the  sales  \\nmanager, the IT manager, the operations head and several others. Bakshi had  sent it to the entire directory of people in our client base. I have to say, he is  \\nbetter at being a mass-suck-up than a gangbang porn star.\\n‘He has copied everyone. Senior management in Boston in the “to”  \\nfield, and then India senior management in the “cc” field,’ I said.\\n‘And yet somehow he forgot to copy us. Bakshi the great,’ Vroom said.\\nI read out the contents of his short mail:\\n‘Dear All,\\nAttached please find the much-awaited user manual of the customer  \\nservice website that changed the parameters of customer service at Western  \\nAppliances. I just wrapped this up today. I would love to discus this more  \\nwhen I’m in Boston…’\\nI let out a silence whistle.\\n‘Boston? How is that ass going to Boston,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Bakshi’s going to Boston,’ Vroom said. ‘Any of you ladies want to tag  \\nalong?’\\n‘What?’ Esha said. ‘What is he going to Boston for?’\\n‘To talk about our website. Must have swung a trip for himself,’ I said.\\n‘What the hell is going on here anyway? On one hand we are downsizing  \\nto save costs, on the other hand there is cash to send idiots on trips to the  \\nUS?’ Vroom said and threw his stress ball on the table. It hit the pen stand and  \\nthe contents fell out.\\n‘Careful,’ Esha said, sounding irritated, as a few pens rolled towards  \\nher. She had her mobile phone in her hand, probably  still trying to call  \\nsomeone.\\n‘Madness. That is what this Connexions is. Boston!’ Priyanka said and  \\nshook her head. She was surfing the Internet. I wondered which sites she was  \\nlooking at—wedding dresses, life in the US, or the Lexus official website.\\nI was about to close Bakshi’s message when vroom stopped me.\\n‘Open the document,’ Vroom said, ‘just open the file he sent,\\n‘It’s the same file we sent him. The user manual,’ I said.\\n‘Did you open it?’\\n‘No, what is the need…’\\n‘Just open it,’ he said so loudly that Esha looked at us. I wondered  \\nwhom she was calling this late, but Vroom’s voice was battering into me.\\nI opened the file, which was our user manual.\\n‘Here, it is the same,’ I said, and scrolled down. As I reached the bottom  \\nof the first page, my jaw grew lax, partly in horror and partly in reflex  \\npreparation to voice some major curse words.\\nWestern Computers Troubleshooting Website\\nProject Details and User Manual.\\nDeveloped by Connexions, Delhi\\nSubhash Bakshi\\nManager, Connexions‘Like fuck it is the same,’ Vroom said  and threw the pens he had  \\ncollected back on the table. One landed on Esha’s lap, who by this time had  \\ntried to connect to a number at least twenty times. She threw an angry look  \\nat Vroom and hurled the pen back at him. He ignored her as his eyes were on  \\nmy screen.\\n‘It says it is by fucking Subhash Bakshi,’ Vroom said., tapping his finger  \\nhard on my monitor. ‘Check this out. Mr Moron, who can’t tell a computer  \\nfrom a piano, has done this website and this manual. Like crap he has.’\\nVroom banged his fists on the table. In a mini-fit, he violently swept the  \\ntable with his hands. All the pens fell on the floor.\\n‘What is wrong with you?’ Esha said and pulled her chair away to avoid  \\nto shower of pens. Desperately shaking the phone to get a connection, she got  \\nup and went to the conference room.\\n‘He passed off our work as his, Shyam. Do you realize that/’ he said and  \\nshook my shoulder hard.\\nI was numb as I started at the first page of our, or rather Bakshi’s,  \\nmanual. This time Bakshi had bypassed himself in stealing credit. My head felt  \\ndizzy and I fought to breathe.\\n‘This is so crap. Six months of work on this manual alone,’ I said and  \\nclosed the file. ‘I never thought he would stoop this low.’\\n‘And?’ Vroom said.\\n‘And what? I don’t really know what to do. I’m in shock. Plus, right now  \\nthere is this fear he may downsize us…’ I said.\\n‘Downsize us?’ Vroom said and stood up. ‘We worked on it for six  \\nmonths man. And all you can say is we can’t do anything as he may downsize  \\nus? This fucking loser Bakshi is turning you into a loser. Mr Shyam, you are  \\nturning into a mousepad, people are rolling over you everyday. Priyanka tell  \\nhim t say something. Go to Bakshi’s office and hold his damn collar.’\\nPriyanka looked up at us, and for the second time that night, our eyes  \\nmet bang on. She had that look; that same gaze that had made me feel small  \\nbefore. Like what was the point of even shouting at me.\\nShe shook her head and gave a wry smile. I knew that wry smile by  \\nheart, too. Like she had known this was coming all along. I had the urge to go  \\nshake her by the collar. It is freaking easy to give those looks when you have a  \\nLexus waiting for you, I wanted to say. But I didn’t say anything. Bakshi’s  \\nmove had hurt me—it wasn’t just the six months of efforts, but also that the  \\nprospects for my promotion were gone. And that meant—proof!—Priyanka was  \\ngoing too. But right now the people see you as weak if you express hurt.  They  \\nalways want to see you strong, meaning in a raging temper. Maybe I do not  \\nhave it in me. That is why I am not a team leader. That is why no girls  \\ndistribute sweets in the office for me.\\n‘Are you there, My Shyam?’ Vroom said. ‘Let’s email all the people this  \\nwas sent to and tell them what is going on.’\\n‘Just cool down Vroom. There is no need to act like a hero,’ I snapped.‘Oh really? So, what should we act like? Losers? Tell us Shyam, you  \\nshould be the expert on that,’ Vroom said.\\nA surge of anger chocked me. ‘Just shut up and sit down,’ I said. ‘What  \\ndo you want to do? Send another mail to the whites? And tell them there’s in-\\nfighting going on here? And whom are they going to believe: somebody who is  \\ngoing to Boston to meet them or some frustrated agent who claim he did all  \\nthe work? Get real Mr Vroom. You’ll get fired and noting else. Bakshi is  \\nmanagement—he  manages,  yes,  he  does.  But  only  his  own  even  notice  \\nRadhika. She was standing next to me with a bottle of water in her hand.\\n‘Thanks,’ I said and took a few noisy sips.\\n‘Feeling better?’ Radhika said.\\nI raised my hand to stop her from saying more. ‘I don’t want to talk  \\nabout this anymore. It is between us and Bakshi. And I don’t want some  \\nrandom people, whose life is one big party, to give their opinion on it. Yes,  \\nmy boss sucks. Most bosses suck. It isn’t such a big deal,’ I said and sat down. I  \\nglared at Vroom. He sat down as well.\\nVroom opened a notepad and drew a 2x2 matrix.\\n‘What the fuck is that/’ I said.\\n‘I think I’ve finally figured Bakshi out. Let me explain with the help of a  \\ndiagram,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Don’t mess with me. I don’t want any diagrams,’ I said.\\n‘Just hear me,’ Vroom said as he labeled the matrix.\\nOn the horizontal axis he wrote ‘good’ and ‘evil’ next to each box. On  \\nthe vertical axis, he wrote ‘smart’ and ‘stupid.’\\n‘Okay, here is my theory about people like Bakshi,’ Vroom said and  \\npointed with his pen to the matrix. ‘There are four kinds of bosses in this  \\nworld based on two dimensions: a) how smart or stupid they are, and b)  \\nwhether they are good or evil. Only with extreme good luck do you get a boss  \\nwho is smart and a good human being. However, Bakshi is the most dangerous  \\nbut common category. He is stupid, as we all know. But more than that—he is  \\nevil,’ Vroom said, tapping his pen in the relevant quadrant of the matrix.\\n‘Stupid-evil,’ I echoed.\\n‘Yes, we understand him. He is scary one. He is like a blind snake: you  \\nfeel sorry for it, but it still has a poisonous bite. You can see it—he is stupid,  \\nhence the call center is so mismanaged. But he is also evil, so he will make  \\nsure all of us go down instead of him.’\\nI shook my head.\\n‘Forget it. Destiny has put an asshole in my path. What can I say,’ I said  \\nand smirked.\\nRadhika  took  the  bottle  from  my  desk.  ‘Sorry  to  interrupt  your  \\ndiscussion guys, but I hope you weren’t talking about me when you said  \\npeople whose life is a party. My life is not a party, my friend. It really isn’t—‘\\n‘—It  wasn’t  you,  Radhika.  Shyam  most  clearly  meant  me.’  Priyanka  \\ninterrupted Radhika.\\n‘Oh forget it,’ I said and stood up. I moved from the desk just to get  \\naway from these nagging people. As I felt, I could hear Vroom’s words: ‘If I  could just once have the opportunity to fuck this Bakshi’s happiness, I’d  \\nconsider myself the luckiest person on earth.’#20\\nI walked away from the WASG desk. My mind was still messed up. I felt  \\nlike cutting Bakshi into little bits and feeding those bits to every street dog in  \\nDelhi. I approached the conference room. The door was shut. I knocked and  \\nwaited for a few seconds. Everything seemed quiet inside.\\n‘Esha? I said and turned the knob to open the door.\\nEsha was sitting one of the conference room chairs. Her right leg was  \\nbent and resting on another chair. She was examining the wound on her shin.\\nShe held a blood-tipped box cutter in her hand. I noticed a used band-\\naid on the table. There was fresh blood coming out of the wound on her shin.\\n‘Are you okay?’ I said, moving close to her.\\nEsha turned to look at me with a black expression.\\n‘Oh hi Shyam,’ she said in a calm tone.\\n‘What are you doing here? Everyone’s looking for you.’\\n‘Why? Why would anyone look for me?’\\n‘No  particular  reason.  What  are  you  doing  here  anyway?  And  your  \\nwound is bleeding, do you want some lotion or a bandage/’ I said and looked  \\naway. The sight of blood nauseates me. I don’t know how doctors show up to  \\nwork everyday.\\n‘No Shyam, I like it like this. With lotion, it may stop hurting,’ Esha said.\\n‘What?’ I said. ‘Isn’t that the idea? You want the pain to end, right?’\\n‘No, Esha smiled sadly. She pointed to the wound with the box cutter.  \\n‘This pain takes my mind away from the real pain. Do you know what real pain  \\nis, Shyam?’\\nI really had no idea what this girl was saying. But I knew if she didn’t  \\ncover the wound soon, I’d throw up my recently consumed chocolate cake.\\n‘Listen, I’ll get the first-aid kit from the supplies room.’\\n‘You didn’t answer my question. What is the real pain, Shyam/’\\n‘I don’t know…what is it?’ I said, shifting anxiously as I saw fresh drops  \\nof blood trickle down her smooth leg.\\n‘Real pain is mental pain,’ Esha said.\\n‘Right,’ I said, trying to sound intelligent. I sat down on a chair next to  \\nher.\\n‘Ever felt mental pain, Shyam?’\\n‘I don’t know if I have. I’m a shallow guy, you see. I don’t feel a lot of  \\nthings,’ I said.\\n‘Everyone feels pain, because everyone has a dark side to their life.’\\n‘Dark side?’\\n‘Yes, dark side—something you don’t like about yourself, something that  \\nmakes you angry or something that you fear, all this makes up our dark side.  \\nDo you have a dark side, Shyam/’\\n‘Oh let’s not go there. I have so many—like half a dozen dark sides. I am  \\nlike dark-sided hexagon,’ I said.‘Ever felt guilt, Shyam? Real hard, painful guilt?’ she said as her voice  \\nbecame weak.\\n‘What happened, Esha/’ I said, as I finally found a position that allowed  \\nme to look at her face but avoid a view of her wound.\\n‘Can you promise not to judge me if I tell you something?’\\n‘Of course,’ I said, as it took me a second to figure out what ‘slept’  \\nmeant. It didn’t mean ‘zzzs.’\\n‘Yes, my agent said this man was connected. I just had to sleep with him  \\nonce to get a break in a major fashion show. Nobody forced me. I choose to do  \\nit. But ever since, I feel this awful guilt. Every single moment. I thought it  \\nwould pass, but it hasn’t. and that pain is so bad, this wound in my leg feels  \\nlike a tickle,’ she said and took the box cutter to her shin. She started  \\nscrapping skin around the wound.\\n‘Stop it Esha, what are you doing/’ I said and snatched the box cutter  \\nfrom her. ‘Are you insane? You’ll get tetanus or gangrene or whatever other  \\nhorrible-things they show on TV in those vaccination ads.’\\n‘This is tame. I’ll tell you what is dangerous. Your own fucked up brain,  \\nthe delusional voice in you that says you have it in you to become a model.  \\nYou know what this man said afterwards/’\\n‘Which man?’ I said as I shoved the box cutter to the other side of the  \\ntable.\\n‘The guy I slept with—a forty-year-old designer. He told my agent later I  \\nwas too short to be a ramp model,’ Esha said, her voice rising as anger  \\nmingled with sadness. ‘Like the bastard didn’t know that when he slept with  \\nme.’ She began crying. I don’t know what is worse—a shouting girl or a crying  \\none. I’m awful at handling either. I placed my hands on Esha’s shoulders,  \\nready for a hug in case she needed it.\\n‘And that son of a bitch sends some cash as compensation afterwards,’  \\nshe said, now sobbing. ‘And my agent tells me, this is part of life. Sure it is  \\npart of life—part of Esha the failed model’s fucked-up life. Give me my box  \\ncutter back, Shyam,’ she said, spreading a palm.\\n‘No,  I  won’t.  Listen,  now  I  am  not  really  sure  what  to  do  in  this  \\nsituation, but just take it easy,’ I said. It was true; nobody would ever demand  \\nto  have  sex  with  me.  Therefore,  feeling-guilty-after-demanded-sex  was  \\ncompletely unfamiliar territory.\\n‘I hate myself, Shyam. I just hate myself. And I hate my face, and the  \\nstupid mirror that shows me this face. I hate myself for believing people who  \\ntold me I could be a model. Can I get my face altered?’\\nI did not know of any plastic surgeons who specialized in turning pretty  \\ngirls ugly, so I kept quiet. She stopped crying after ninety seconds, around the  \\ntime any girl would stop crying if you ignored her. She took a tissue from her  \\nbag and wiped her eyes,\\n‘Shall we go? They must be waiting,’ I said. She held my hand to stand  \\nup.\\n‘Thanks for listening to me,’ Esha said. Only women think there is a  \\nreason to thank people if they listen to them.#21\\nTo my disgust, Priyanka’s wedding was still the topic of discussion when  \\nEsha and I returned to the bay.\\nEsha sat down quietly.\\n‘Now where were you?’ Priyanka asked Esha.\\n‘Here only. Wanted to make a private call,’ Esha said.\\n‘I’m taking mother-in-law tips from Radhika,’ Priyanka said. I’m so not  \\nlooking forward to that part. She seems nice now, but who knows how she will  \\nturn out.’\\n‘C’mon, you are getting so much more in return. Ganesh is such a nice  \\nguy,’ Radhika said.\\n‘Anyway I’d take three mothers-in-law for a Lexus. Bring it on man’  \\nVroom said.\\nRadhika and Priyanka started laughing.\\n‘I’ll miss you Vroom,’ Priyanka said, still laughing, ‘I really will.’\\n‘Who else will you miss?’ Vroom said and all of us fell silent.\\nPriyanka shifted on her seat: Vroom had caught her on the spot. She did  \\nnot want to say my name, I knew it.\\n‘Oh I’ll miss all of you,’ she said, diplomacy queen that she can be when  \\nshe wants to. She thinks she can outsmart the world with her boring replies.\\n‘Whatever, Vroom said.\\n‘Anyway, don’t wish for three mothers-in-law, Vroom. It can be like  \\nasking for three Bakshis. Well, at least it can be for women, Radhika said.\\n‘So your mother-in-law is evil?’ Vroom said.\\n‘I never said she is bad. But she did say those things to Anuj. What will  \\nhe think?’\\n‘Nothing. He won’t think anything. He knows how lucky he is to have  \\nyou,’ Priyanka said firmly.\\n‘It is hard sometimes. She isn’t my mom, after all.’\\n‘Oh, don’t go there. I can get along with anyone else’s mom better than  \\nmy own. My mom’s neurosis has made me mother-in-law proof,’ Priyanka  \\nsaid, and everyone on the desk laughed. I did not, as there is nothing funny  \\nabout Priyanka’s mom to me. Emotional manipulators like her should be put in  \\njail and made to watch sappy TV serials all day.\\n‘Anuj should be okay, right? Tell me guys: he won’t hate me?’ Radhika  \\nsaid.\\n‘No,’ Priyanka got up and went to Radhika. ‘He loves you and he will be  \\nfine.’\\n‘You want to check if he is okay?’ Vroom said. ‘I have an idea.’ \\n‘What?’ Radhika said.I looked at Vroom. What the hell did he have to say about Anuj and  \\nRadhika?\\n‘Let’s play radio jockey,’ Vroom said. ‘it’s really fun.’\\n‘What is radio jockey?’ Radhika was baffled.\\n‘Well. I call Anuj and pretend I cam calling from a radio show. Then I tell  \\nhim  he  has  won  a  prize,  a  large  bouquet  of  roses  and  a  box  of  Swiss  \\nchocolates that he can send to anyone he loves, anywhere in India, with a  \\nloving message. So then, we all get to hear what romantic lines he says to  \\nyou.’\\n‘C’mon, it will never work,’ Priyanka said. ‘You can’t sound like an RJ.’\\n‘Trust me. I am a call center agent. I can make a convincing RJ.’ Vroom  \\nsaid.\\nI was curious to see how Vroom would do his RJ act. \\n‘Okay,’ Vroom said as he got ready, ‘It’s show time, folks. Take line five  \\neveryone. And no noise: breathe away from the mouthpiece, okay?’\\nRadhika gave him the number as we took line five. Vroom dialed Anuj’s  \\nmobile phone.\\nWe glued the earpiece to our ears. The telephone rang five times.\\n‘He’s sleeping,’ Priyanka whispered.\\n‘Shhh,’ Vroom went, as we heard someone pick up.\\n‘Hello?’ Anuj said in a sleepy voice.\\n‘Hello there, my friend, is this 98101-46301?’ Vroom said in an insanely  \\ncheerful, radio jockey voice.\\n‘Yes, who is it?’ Anuj said.\\n‘It is your lucky call for tonight. This is RJ Max calling from Radio City  \\n98.5 FM, and you my friend have just won a prize.’\\n‘Radio City? Are you trying to sell me something?’ Anuj said. I guess  \\nbeing a salesperson himself, he was skeptical.\\n‘No my friend, I am not selling anything—no credit cards, no insurance  \\npolicies and no phone plans. I am just going to offer you a small prize from  \\nour sponsor Interflora and you can request a song if you want to. Man, people  \\ndoubt me so much these days,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Sorry, I was just not sure,’ Anuj said.\\n‘Max is the name. What’s yours?’ Vroom said. \\n‘Anuj,’\\n‘Nice talking to you Anuj. Where are you right now?’\\n‘Kolkata.’\\n‘Oh, the land of sweets, excellent. Anyway, Anuj, you get to send a  \\ndozen red roses with your message to anyone in India. This service is brought  \\nto you by Interflora, one of the world’s largest flower delivery companies.’\\nVroom was like a pro, I must admit.\\n‘And I don’t have to pay anything? Thanks Interflora,’ Anuj said with  \\nsuitable gratitude.\\nAll of us had out mouths shut right and the headset mouthpiece covered  \\nwith our hands.‘No my friend, no payment at all. So are you ready with your special  \\nperson’s name and address?’\\n‘Yes sure. I’d like to send it to my girlfriend Payal.’\\nI think the earth shook beneath us. I looked at Vroom’s face, his jaw  \\nhad dropped wide open. He waved a hand in confusion. \\n‘Payal?’ Vroom said, his voice dropping to more normal levels, less  \\nexuberant than that of a hyperactive RJ.\\n‘Yes, she is my girlfriend. She lives in Delhi. She is modern type of girl,  \\nso please make the bouquet trendy…’ Anuj said.\\nRadhika could not stay silent any longer.\\n‘Payal? What did you just say, Anuj? Your girlfriend Payal?’ Radhika said.\\n‘Who is that?...Radhika…?’\\n‘Yes, Radhika. Your fucking wife Radhika.’\\n‘What is going on here? Who is this Max guy, hey Max?’ Anuj said.\\nI  think  the  Max  guy  just  died.  Vroom  put  his  hand  on  his  head,  \\nwondering what to say next.\\n‘You talk to me, you asshole,’ Radhika said, probably cursing for the  \\nfirst time since she got married. ‘What message were you going to send this  \\nPayal?’\\n‘Radhika, honey. Listen this is a prank. Max? Max?\\n‘There is no Max. it is Vroom here,’ Vroom said in a black voice.\\n‘You bastar—‘ Anuj began before Radhika –stood up and cut the line. She  \\nset back down on her chair, stunned. A few seconds later, she broke into  \\ntears.\\nVroom looked at Radhika. ‘damn, Radhika I am so sorry,’ he said.\\nRadhika did not answer. She just cried and cried. In between, she lifted  \\nthe half-knit scarf to wipe her tears. Something told me Radhika would never  \\nfinish the scarf.\\nEsha held Radhika’s hand tight. Maybe the tear bug passed through  \\nhands because Esha started crying as well. Priyanka went and brought back  \\nwater. Radhika poured out a glassful of tears, and drank the glass of water.\\n‘Take it easy. It’s probably  a misunderstanding,’ Priyanka  said. She  \\nlooked at Esha, puzzled about why Esha was so upset over Payal, I guess  \\nEsha’s ‘real pain’ was back.\\nRadhika rifled through her bag looking for her headache pills. She only  \\nfound an empty blister pack. She mouthed some curses and threw it aside.\\n‘Radhika/’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Just leave me alone for a few minutes,’ Radhika said.\\n‘Girls, I really need to talk,’ Esha said, a she wiped her tears.\\n‘What’s  up?’  Priyanka  said  as  she  looked  at  Esha.  They  exchanged  \\nglances: Esha used the female telepathic network to ask Priyanka to come to  \\nthe toilet. Priyanka tapped Radhika’s shoulder and the girls stood up.\\n‘Now where are you girls going?’ Vroom said. ‘I caused this situation.  \\nCan’t you talk here?’\\n‘We have our private stuff to discuss,’ Priyanka said firmly to Vroom and  \\nleft the desk.‘What’s up? What’s the deal with Esha?’ Vroom said to me after the girls  \\nwere out of sight.\\n‘Nothing,’ I said.\\n‘C’mon tell me, she must have told you in the conference room.’\\n‘I can’t tell you,’ I said and looked at my screen. I tried to change the  \\ntopic. ‘Do you think Bakshi experts us to prepare for his team meeting?’\\n‘I think Esha is sad because she regards saying no to me,’ Vroom said.\\nI smirked\\n‘If not that, then what is it?’ Vroom said, looking at me with a puzzled  \\nexpression. I shrugged my shoulders.\\n‘Fine. I’ll use our earlier technique. I am going to the toilet to find out,’  \\nVroom said.\\n‘No Vroom, no,’ I said. I tried to grab his shirt, but he pulled away and  \\nwent to the men’s room.\\nI did not chase after him. I did not care if he found out. I figured he  \\nought to know what his live interest was up to anyway. I called systems and  \\ntold them the calls had not resumed yet. They promised to come to my desk  \\nwith the new cable within ‘five minutes maximum’. I guess systems guys are  \\nbusy. Computers are supposed to help men—but enough computers need help  \\nfrom men as well.\\nWith no one at the desk and systems down, I decided to take a walk  \\naround the room. I passed by Military Uncle’s raised his head. I looked at his  \\nface: his wrinkles seemed more pronounced, making him look older.\\n‘My son replied to the mail I sent,’ he said. ‘I think the file was too big.’\\n‘Really? What did he say? I said.\\nMilitary Uncle shook his head and put his head back on the desk. The  \\nmessage on his screen caught my eye. It was an email from his son.\\nDad...  you  have  cluttered  my  life  enough,  now  stop  \\ncluttering my mailbox. I do not know what came over me that I  \\nallowed communication between you and my son. I don’t want  \\nyour shadow on him. Please stay away and do not send him any  \\nmore  emails.  For  literally  or  otherwise,  we  don’t  want  your  \\nattachments.\\n‘It’s nothing,’ Uncle said, as he closed all the windows on his screen. ‘I  \\nshould get back to work. What happened? Your systems are down again?’\\n‘A lot is down tonight, not just the systems,’ I said and returned to my  \\nseat.#2  2  \\n‘Did you know?’ Vroom whispered to me as he returned from the men’s  \\ntoilet.\\n‘What?’ I said.\\n‘Esha’s big bad story.’\\n‘I’d rather not discuss it.. it’s her private matter.’\\n‘No wonder she won’t go out with me. She needs to romp her way to  \\nthe ramp doesn’t she?’ Bitch.’\\n‘Mind your language,’ I said, ‘and where are the girls?’\\n‘Coming back soon. Your chick was consoling Radhika when I left.’\\n‘Priyanka is not my chick Vroom. Will you just shut up?’ I said.\\n‘Okay, I will shut up. That is what a good call center agent does right?  \\nCrap happens around him and he just smiles and says how can I help you/  \\nLike, someone just slept with the one girl I care for. But it is okay right? Pass  \\nme the next dumb customer.’\\n‘The girls are coming,’ I said as I saw them return. ‘Pretend you know  \\nnothing about Esha.’\\nThe desk was silent as the girls took their seats. Vroom was about to say  \\nsomething, but I signaled him to be quiet. The systems guy finally showed up  \\nwith new kick-proof wires and re-installed our systems. I was relieved as calls  \\nbegan to trickle in. sorting Americans’ oven and fridge problems was easier  \\nthen solving our life’s problems.\\nI looked at Priyanka once; she was busy with a caller. ‘My  chick,’ I \\nsmirked to myself at Vroom’s comment. She was no longer my chick. She was  \\ngoing to marry a rich, successful guy—someone who had no competition from  \\na loser like me. Certainly not after Bakshi backstabbed me with his website, I  \\nthought. But had I given up? Did I still feel for her ? I shook my head at the  \\nirrelevant questions. How did it matter if I still felt for her? I did not deserve  \\nher, and I was not going to get her. That was reality, and as is often the case  \\nwith me, reality sucks,\\nEsha was still quite subdued after returning from the toilet. Priyanka  \\nwas trying to cheer her up.\\n‘Get a flowing lehnga for the engagement. But what will you wear for  \\nthe wedding? A sari?’ Priyanka asked Esha between calls.\\n‘My navel rig will show,’ Esha said.\\nI am constantly amazed at the ability of women to calm down. All they  \\nneed to do is talk, hug and cry it out for ten minutes—and then they can face  \\nany of life’s crap. Esha’s ‘real pain’ was obviously much better, or she was at  \\nleast distracted from it, given she could discuss her dress plans for Priyanka’s  \\nbig day.\\n‘Don’t  do  anything  elaborate,’  Priyanka  said,  ‘I’m  going  to  tell  my  \\nmother I want a simple sari. Of course, she will freak out. Hey Radhika, are  \\nyou okay?’ Priyanka said, as she noticed Radhika massaging her forehead.‘I’ll be fine. I am just one of migraine pills,’ Radhika said as she picked  \\nup a call. ‘Western Appliances, Regina speaking. How may I help you?’\\nThe landline telephone’s ring caught everyone’s attention.\\nThis is my call. Guys I know system is live, but can I take this call?’  \\nPriyanka said.\\n‘Sure.  Call  flow  is  so  light  anyways,’  Vroom  said  as  the  landline  \\ncontinued to ring.\\nPriyanka’s  hand  reached for the telephone. I casualty switched  the  \\noption on my screen to listen in to the conversation.\\n‘By the way, dark blue mice is also a good colour,’ Vroom said as  \\nPriyanka lifted the receiver.\\n‘What?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘I saw the Lexus website, dark blue mica is their best colour,’ Vroom  \\nsaid.\\nI threw Vroom a disgusted glance.\\n‘At least that is what I think,’ Vroom’s voice dropped as he intercepted  \\nmy look.\\n‘Hello, my center of attention,’ Ganesh’s beaming voice came over  \\nPriyanka and my phones.\\n‘Hi Ganesh,’ Priyanka said sedately.\\n‘What’s up, Priya? You sound serious,’ Ganesh said.\\nPriyanka hates it when people shorten her name to Priya. This moron  \\ndid not know that.\\n‘Nothing. Just having a rough day...sorry night. And please call  me  \\nPriyanka, she said.\\n‘Well, I am having a rocking day here. Everyone in office is so excited  \\nfor  me.  They  keep  asking  me  “so  when  is  the  date?”,  “Where  is  the  \\nhoneymoon?”’ \\n‘Yeah Ganesh, about the date,’ Priyanka said, ‘my mom just called.’\\n‘She did. Oh no. I thought I’d give you the good news myself.’\\n‘What good news?’\\n‘That I am coming to India next month. We should get married then  \\nonly. What say, honeymoon straight from there? People said the Bahamas is  \\namazing. But I’ve always wanted to go to Paris. Because what could be more  \\nromantic than Paris.’\\n‘Ganesh,’ Priyanka said, her voice frantic.\\n‘What?’\\n‘Can I say something?’\\n‘Sure. But first tell me, Paris or Bahamas?’\\n‘Ganesh.’\\n‘Please tell me where you’d rather go.’\\n‘Paris. Now can I say something?’ Priyanka said.\\nEsha and Radhika raised their eyebrows when they heard the word  \\nParis. It was not difficult to guess that honeymoon planning was in progress.\\n‘Sure. What do you want to say?’ Ganesh said.\\n‘Don’t you think it is a little rushed?’‘What?’\\n‘Our marriage. We have only talked to each other for a week. I know,  \\nwe spoke quite a bit, but still.’\\n‘You’ve said yes to me right?’ Ganesh said.\\n‘Yes, but…’\\n‘Then why wait? I don’t get much leave here. And considering I now  \\nspend my every living moment thinking about you, I’d rather get you here at  \\nthe earliest.’\\n‘But, this is marriage Ganesh. Not just a vacation. W have to give each  \\nother time to get ready for this,’ Priyanka said and twirled a strand of hair  \\nwith her finger. I used to love playing with her hair when we were together.\\n‘But,’ Ganesh said, ‘you spoke to your mother, right? You heard how  \\nhappy she is about us getting married next month. My family is excited as  \\nwell. Marriage is a family occasion too, right?’\\n‘I know. Listen, maybe I am just having a rough night. Let me sleep over  \\nit.’\\n‘Sure. Take your time. But did you think of a color?’\\n‘For what? The car/’\\n‘Yeah, I am going to pay the deposit tomorrow. So it is there when you  \\narrive—assuming you agree to next month, of course.’\\n‘I can’t say. Wait, I heard dark blue mica is nice.’\\n‘Really? I kind of like black,’ Ganesh said.\\n‘Well then take black. Don’t let me…’ Priyanka said.\\n‘No, dark blue mica it is. I like that colour. I’ll tell the dealer it is my  \\nwife’s choice.\\nThe words ‘my wife’ sizzled my inside the way they fry French fries at  \\nMcDonald’s. I closed my eyes for a few seconds. I could not bear to hear  \\nanother man talk like this to Priyanka.\\n‘Hey Ganesh, it is 2:25 a.m. here. I have to get ready for a 2:30 meeting  \\nwith the boss. Can we talk later?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Sure. I might leave work early today. Maybe see some new tiles for the  \\npool. But I’ll call you when I get home okay?’\\n‘Pool?’ Priyanka said, as she took the bait.\\n‘Yes, we have a small swimming pool in our house.\\n‘Our house? You mean you have a private pool?’\\n‘Of Course. You know how to swim?’\\n‘I have never stepped inside a pool in my life,’ Priyanka said,.\\n‘Well, I can teach you. I am sure there are many interesting possibilities  \\nin the pool.’\\nThe French fries were burnt charcoal black from being over friend.\\n‘Bye Ganesh,’ Priyanka smiled and shook her head. ‘You guys are all the  \\nsame.’\\nShe hung up the phone.\\n‘What’s up,’ Esha said as she filed her nails.\\n‘Nothing, same stuff. First tell me, you okay?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘I am fine please keep me distracted. I heard Paris.’‘Yes,  honeymoon  destination.  And  of  course,  more  pressure  to  get  \\nmarried next month. I don’t want to, but I just might have to give in.’\\n‘Well, if it means seeing Paris sooner rather than later…’ Esha said and  \\nlooked over at us. ‘Right guys?’\\n‘Sure,’ Vroom said. ‘What do you think Shyam/’\\nStupid ass, I hate Vroom.\\n‘Me?’ I said as everyone continued to look at me. Esha kept staring at  \\nme for five seconds non-stop. I did not want to come across as sulking for  \\nchildish, my new tag for the night), so I responded.\\n‘Sure,  might  as  well  get  it  done.  Then  go  to  Paris  or  Bahamas  or  \\nwhatever.’\\nDamn. I kicked myself as the words left my mouth. Priyanka heard me  \\nand looked at me. Her nose twitched as she thought hard.\\n‘What did you just say Shyam?’ Priyanka said slowly, looking straight at  \\nme, her nostrils flaring big-time.\\n‘Nothing,’ I said, avoiding eye contact. ‘I just said get married and go to  \\nParis sooner.’\\n‘No,  you  also  said  Bahamas.  How  did  you  know  Ganesh  mentioned  \\nBahamas?’ Priyanka said.\\nI kept quite.\\n‘Answer me, Shyam. Ganesh also suggested Bahamas, but I didn’t tell  \\nyou guys. How did you know he’d said that?’\\n‘I don’t know anything. I just randomly said it,’ I said, trying to be  \\nconvincing, but my shaking voice was giving me away.\\n‘Were you listening to my conversation? Shyam, have you played around  \\nwith the phone?’ Priyanka said and got up. She lifted the landline phone and  \\npulled it away from the table. The wires followed her. She looked down under  \\nthe table and tugged at the wires again. A little wire tensed up all the way  \\nback to my seat. Damn, busted, I thought.\\n‘Shyam,’ Priyanka screamed at the top of her voice and banged the  \\nlandline instrument on the table.\\n‘Yes,’ I said, as calmly as possible.\\n‘What is going on here? I cannot believe you could sink so low. This is  \\nthe height of indecency,’ she said.\\nAt least I had achieved the heights in something. I thought. \\nRadhika and Esha looked at me. I threw up my hands, pretending to be  \\nignorant of the situation.\\nVroom stood  and went up to Priyanka.  He put his arm around her  \\nshoulder, ‘C’mon Priyanka, take it east. We are all having a rough night here.’\\n‘Shut up. This is insane,’ she said and turned to me. ‘How could you tap  \\ninto my personal calls? I can complain about this and get you fired.’\\n‘Then  do  it,’  I  said,  ‘what  are  you  waiting  for?  Get  me  fired.  Do  \\nwhatever?’\\nVroom looked at Priyanka and then at me. Realizing he could not do too  \\nmuch to help, he returned to his seat.\\nEsha pulled Priyanka’s hand, making her sit down again.‘What the…he…’ Priyanka said, anger and impending tears showing in  \\nher voice. ‘Can’t once expect just a little decent from their colleagues?’\\nI guess I was just a colleague now. An indecent colleague at that.\\n‘Say something,’ Priyanka said to me.\\nI stayed silent and disconnected the tapped wire. I showed her the  \\nunhooked cable and threw it on the table.\\nOur eyes met. Even though we were silent, our eyes communicated.\\nMy eyes said to her: Why are you humiliating me?\\nHer eyes said to me: Why are you doing this Shyam?\\nI think eye-talk is more effective than word-talk. Every now and then,  \\nhuman beings should shut up and let their eyes speak. But Priyanka was in no  \\nmood to be silent.\\n‘Why Shyam why? Why do you do such childish, immature things? I  \\nthought we were going to make this amicable. We agreed to some terms and  \\nconditions, didn’t we?’\\nI did not want to discuss our terms and conditions in public. I wanted  \\nher to shut up and for me to scream instead. However, I was in the wrong,  \\nlike the car driver who hits a bicycle. I had no choice but to stay quiet. I had  \\nto pay for my ‘childishness’.\\n’We said we could continue to work together. And that even if we have  \\nended our relationship, we do not have to end our friendship. But this?’ she  \\nsaid and lifted the wire to the table. Then she threw it down again.\\n‘Sorry,’ I said, or rather whispered.\\n‘What/’ she said.\\n‘Sorry,’ I said, this time loud and clear. I hate it when she does this to  \\nhumiliate me. Fuck it, if you have heard an apology—just accept it.\\n‘Do me a huge favour. Stay out of my life pleas. Will you?’ Priyanka said,  \\nher voice heavy with the sarcasm she had picked up from me.\\nI looked up at her and nodded. I felt like putting her and Ganesh in their  \\ndark blue mica Lexus, wrapping it with the landline wire and drowning it in  \\nGanesh’s new pool.\\nVroom sniggered, even as he continued clicking his mouse. A smile  \\nrippled over Esha and Radhika as well.\\n‘What’s so funny?’ Priyanka said, her face still red.\\n‘It’s okay, Priyanka. C’mon, can’t you take it in a bit of good humor?’  \\nVroom said.\\n‘Your humor,’ Priyanka said and paused, ‘has a tumor. It isn’t funny to  \\nme at all.’\\n‘It’s 2:30 guys,’ Esha said and clapped her hands, ‘time to got o Bakshi’s  \\noffice.’\\nPriyanka and I gave each other one final glare before we got up to  \\nleave.\\n‘Is Military Uncle required?’ Esha said.\\n‘No. just the voice agents,’ I said. I looked at Military Uncle at the end  \\nof the room. I could see he was busy at the chat helpline.\\n‘Let’s go Radhika,’ Vroom said.‘Do you think he loves her? Or is it just sex? Some good, wild sex that  \\nthey share?’ Radhika said.\\n‘You okay Radhika?’ I said.\\n‘Yes, I am fine. I am surprised that I am, actually. I think I must be in  \\nshock.  Or  maybe  nobody  has  taught  me  an  appropriate  reaction  for  this  \\nsituation. My husband is cheating on me. What am I supposed to do? Scream?  \\nCry? What?’\\n‘Nothing for now. Let’s just attend Bakshi’s meeting,’ Vroom said as we  \\nturned to go to Bakshi’s room.\\nMy brain was still fumbling at Priyanka’s words—‘we had terms and  \\nconditions’. Like our break-up was a business contract. Every moment of our  \\nlast date replayed itself as I walked to Bakshi’s office. We had gone to Pizza  \\nHut, and pizzas have never tasted as good ever since.#  23  \\nMy Past Dates with \\nPriyanka—V\\nPizza Hut, Sahara Mall, Gurgaon\\nFour months before this night\\nShe came on time that day. After all, she was coming with a purpose.  \\nThis was not a date—we were meeting to formally break up. Actually, there  \\nwas nothing left in our relationship to break anymore. Still, I had agreed, if  \\nonly to see her face as she told me. She also wanted to discuss how we were  \\nto  interact  with  each  other  and  move  forward.  Discuss,  interact,  move  \\nforward—when you start using words like that, you know the relationship is  \\ndead.\\nWe chose Pizza Hut only because it was, well, convenient. For break-\\nups, location takes priority over ambience. She had come to shop in Sahara  \\nMall, where half of Delhi descends whenever there is a public holiday.\\n‘Hi,’ she said and looked at her watch. ‘Wow! Look, I have actually  \\ncome on time today. How are you?’ she held her shirt collar and shook it for  \\nventilation. ‘I can’t believe it is so hot in July.’\\nPriyanka cannot tolerate awkward silences; she will say anything to fill  \\nin the gaps. Cut the bullshit, I wanted to say, but did not.\\n‘It’s Delhi. What else do you expect?’ I said.\\n‘I  think  most  people  who  come  to  mails  just  come  for  the  air-\\nconditioning—‘\\n‘Can we do this quickly?’ I said, interrupting her. Consumer motives of  \\nmall visitors did not interest me.\\n‘Huh?’ she said, startled by my tone.\\nThe waiter came and took our order. I ordered two separate small  \\ncheese ‘n mushroom pizzas. I did not want to share a large pizza with her,  \\neven though, on a per square inch of pizza basis, the large one worked out  \\nway cheaper.\\n‘I am not good at this break-up stuff, so let’s not drag this out,’ I said.  \\n‘We’ve met for a purpose. So now what? Is there a break-up line that I’m  \\nsupposed to say?’\\nShe stared at me for two seconds. I avoided looking at her nose. Her  \\nnose, I had always felt, belonged to me.\\n‘Well I just thought we could do it in a pleasant manner. We can still be  \\nfriends, right?’ she said.\\nWhat is with women wanting to be friends forever? Why can’t they  \\nmake a clear decision between a boyfriend and no-friends?\\n‘I don’t think so. Both of us have enough friends.’\\n‘See, this is what I don’t like about you. That tone of voice…’ she said.‘I thought we decided not to discuss each other’s flaws today. I have  \\ncome here to break up, not to make a friend or get an in-depth analysis of my  \\nbehavior.’\\nShe kept silent until the pizzas arrived on our table. I started eating a  \\nslice.\\n‘Perhaps you forget that we work together. That makes it a little more  \\ncomplicated,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Like how?’\\n‘Like if there is tension between us, it will make it difficult to focus on  \\nwork—for us and for the others,’ she said.\\n‘So what do you suggest? I have broken up already, now should I resign  \\nas well?’ I said.\\n‘I didn’t say that. Anyway, I am going to be in this job only nine more  \\nmonths. By next year I would have saved enough to fund my B.Ed. Therefore  \\nthe situation will automatically correct itself. But if we can agree to certain  \\nterms and conditions—like if we can remain friendly in the interim…’\\n‘I can’t force myself to be friendly,’ I interrupted her, ‘my approach to  \\nrelationship is different. Sorry if it is not practical enough for you. But I can’t  \\nfake it.’\\n‘I’m not telling you to fake it,’ she said.\\n‘Good. Because you are past the stage of telling me what to do. Now, let  \\nus just get this over with. What are we supposed to say? I now pronounce  \\nourselves broken up? Then we say, I do, I do?’\\nI pushed my plate away. I had completely lost my appetite. I felt like  \\ntossing the pizza like a Frisbee to the end of the room.\\n‘What, say something,’ I said, after she had remained silent for ten  \\nseconds.\\n‘I don’t know what to say,’ she said, her voice cracking.\\n‘Really? No words of advice, no last minute preaching, no moral high  \\nground in these final moments for your good-for-nothing unsettled boyfriends?  \\nC’mon Priyanka, don’t lose your chance to slamming the loser.’\\nShe collected her bag and stood up. She took out a hundred-rupee note  \\nand put it on the table–her contribution for the pizza.\\n‘Okay, she leaves in silence again. Once again I get to be the prick,’ I  \\nmumbled, loud enough for her to hear.\\n‘Shyam,’ she said, slinging her bag on to her shoulder.\\n‘Yes?’ I said.\\n‘You know how you always say you are not good at anything? I don’t  \\nthink that’s true. Because there is something you are quite good at,’ she said.\\n‘What?’ I said. Perhaps she wanted to give me some last minute praise  \\nto make me feel better, I thought.\\n‘You are damn good at hurting people. Keep it up.’\\nWith that, my ex-girlfriend turned around and left.\\n#24We reached Bakshi’s office at 2:30 AM. The size of a one-bedroom flat,  \\nit is probably the largest unproductive office in the world. His desk, on which  \\nhe had a swank flat screen OPC, is at one corner. Behind the desk is a  \\nbookshelf full of heavy management books of a scary thickness. Some of them  \\nare so heavy you can use them as assault weapons. The thought of slamming  \\none hard on Bakshi’s head had often crossed my mind during previous team  \\nmeetings. Apart from blonde threesomes, I think hitting your boss is the  \\nultimate Indian male fantasy.\\nAt another corner of the room is a conference table and six chairs. In  \\nthe center of the table is a speakerphone for multiparty calls with other  \\noffices.\\nBakshi was not in his office when we reached his room. ‘Where the hell  \\nis her?’ Vroom said.\\n‘Maybe he’s in the toilet?’ I said.\\n‘Executive toilet, it is a different feeling,’ Vroom said as I nodded in  \\nagreement.\\nWe  sat  around  Bakshi’s  conference  table.  All  of  us  had  brought  \\nnotebooks to the meeting. We never really used them, but it always seems  \\nnecessary to sit in meetings with an open notebook.\\n‘Where is he?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘I don’t know. Who cares,’ Vroom said and stood up. ‘Hey Shyam, want  \\ntot check out Bakshi’s computer/’ he walked over to Bakshi’s desk.\\n‘What?’ I said. ‘Are you crazy? He will come any minute. What can you  \\nsee so fast anyway?’\\n‘Just for fun. Do you want to know what website Bakshi visits?’ Vroom  \\nsaid and learned over so he could reach Bakshi’s keyboard. He opened up  \\nInternet  Explorer  and  pressed  Ctrl+H  to  pull  out  the  history  of  visited  \\nwebsites.\\n‘Have you gone nuts?’ you’ll get in trouble,’ I said.\\n‘Come back Vroom,’ Esha said.\\n‘Okay, I’ve just fired a printout,’ Vroom said and sprinted across the  \\nroom to Bakshi’s printer. He fetched the printout and leaped back to the  \\nconference table.\\n‘Are you stupid?’ I said.\\n‘Okay guys check this out,’ Vroom said as he held the A4 sheet in front  \\nof him. ‘Timesofindia.com, rediff.com, and then we have, Harvard business  \\nreview website, Boston weather website, Boston places to see, Boston real  \\nestate—‘\\n‘—What with him and Boston?’ Esha said.\\n‘He is going there on a business trip soon,’ Radhika reminded her.\\n‘And what other website?’ I said.\\n‘There is more. Aha, here is what I was looking for: awesomeindia.com—\\nthe best porn site for Indian girls, adultfriendfinder.com—a sex personals site,  cabaretlounge.com—a strip club in Boston, porninspector.com… hello, the list  \\ngoes on this department.’\\n‘What’s with him and Boston?’ I repeated Esha’s words.\\n‘Who knows?’ Vroom said and laughed. ‘hey check this out: the official  \\nwebsite for Viagra, visited six hours ago.’\\n‘I’ll try and ask him about Boston,’ Priyanka said.\\nWe heard Bakshi’s footsteps and Vroom quickly folded the sheet. We  \\nturned quiet and opened our notebooks to fresh blank pages.\\nBakshi took fast steps as he entered his office.\\n‘Sorry team. I had to visit the computers bay team leaders for some  \\npertinent managerial affairs. Si, how is everyone doing tonight?’ Bakshi said as  \\nhe took the last empty seat at his conference table.\\nNo one responded. I nodded my head to show I was doing fine, but  \\nBakshi was not looking at me.\\n‘Team, I have called you today to tell you about a few changes that may  \\nhappen at Connexions. We need to right size people.’ \\n‘So, people are getting fired. It wasn’t a rumor,’ Vroom said. \\nRadhika’s  face  turned  white.  Priyanka  and  Esha  had  a  shocked  \\nexpression.\\n‘We never want to fire people, Mr Victor. But we have to right size  \\nsometime.’\\n‘Why? Why are we firing people when clearly there are other things we  \\ncan do,’ vroom said.\\n‘We have carefully, evaluated all the plausible and feasible alternatives,  \\nI am afraid, ‘Bakshi said and took out a pen. Everyone moved back nervously.  \\nThe last thing we needed was another Bakshi diagram.\\n‘Cost-cutting is the only alternative,’ Bakshi said and began to draw  \\nsomething. However, the pen did not work. He tried to shake it into action, a  \\npointless thing to do with a ball pen. The pen refused to cooperate, perhaps  \\nsick of Bakshi’s abuse.\\nI was going to offer y own pen but Esha, who was sitting at my side,  \\nsensed the movement and quickly pulled at my elbow to stop me. Bakshi  \\ncontinued to lecture us. He spoke non-stop for six minutes (or ninety-six  \\nbreaths). He went into various management philosophies, schools of thought,  \\ncorporate governance methods and other deeply complicated stuff that I know  \\nnothing  about,  his  point  was  that  we  should  make  the  company  more  \\nefficient. He just did not have an efficient way to say it.\\nVroom had promised me he would not mention the website to Bakshi  \\ntonight, at least until the lay-offs were over. However, this did not stop him  \\nfrom taking on Bakshi.\\n‘Sir, but cost-cutting is useless if we have no sales growth. We need  \\nmore clients, not non-stop cuts until there is no company left,’ Vroom said,  \\nafter Bakshi had finished his speech. I guess somewhere within him was a die-\\nhard optimist who really thought Bakshi would listen to him.\\n‘We have though of every alternative,’ Bakshi said. ‘A sales force is too  \\nexpensive.’‘Sir, we can create a sales force. We have thousands of agents. I am  \\nsure some of them are good at sales. We talk to customers every day, so we  \\nkn0ow what they want…’\\n‘But our clients are in the US, we have to sell there.’\\n‘So what? Why don’t we send some agents to the US to try and increase  \\nour clients base. Why not guys? Vroom said and looked at us, as if we would  \\nfuriously  nod  our  heads  in  approval.  I  was  the  only  one  listening,  but  \\nremained quiet.\\nRadhika was doodling on her pad, drawing a pattern that looked like  \\nthis:\\nPriyanka was making a table of numbers on her notepad. I think she was  \\nmaking a calendar to figure out the day she was getting married. I felt like  \\nripping her notebook to shreds. Esha was digging her pen’s nib deep into her  \\nnotepad so that it came out at the other end.\\n‘Send agents to the US? Move them to Boston?’ Bakshi said and laughed.\\n‘Well a few of them, at least on trial basis. Some of them are really  \\nsmart. Who knows, they may get that one client that could save a hundred  \\njobs. Right Shyam?’ Vroom said\\n‘Huh?’ I said startled to hear my name.\\n‘Mr Victor, as a feedback-oriented manager I appreciate your inputs.  \\nHowever, I do not think it is such a good idea,’ Bakshi said.\\n‘Why not?’ Vroom demanded with the innocence of a primary school  \\nkid.\\n‘Because if it was such a good idea, someone would have thought of it  \\nbefore. Why didn’t it strike me for instance?’ Bakshi said.\\n‘Huh?’ Vroom said, completely flabbergasted. I had heard it all before so  \\nit did not move me. I was aware of every red, white, and black blood cell in  \\nBakshi’s body.\\n‘What’s the plan sir, when do we find out who gets fir…I mean right-\\nsized?’ I said. \\n’Soon. We are finalizing the list, but we let you know by this morning or  \\nearly tomorrow night,’ Bakshi said, his forehead showing relief as I had not  \\nchallenged him.\\n‘How many people will lose their job, Sir?’ what percentage?’ Radhika  \\nsaid, her first words in the meeting.‘Thirty to forty is the plan as of now,’ Bakshi said in a practiced, calm  \\nvoice as if he was announcing the temperature outside.\\n‘That’s hundreds of people<’ Vroom said. As if it was such a difficult  \\ncalculation.\\n‘Such is corporate life, my friend,’ Bakshi said and got up, indicating  \\nthat the meeting was over. ‘You know what they say. It is a jungle out there.’  \\nI don’t know who said that, but when I looked at Bakshi, I realized there are  \\nbuffoons in that jungle as well.\\nThe girls collected their notebooks primly and stood up. Vroom sat  \\nthere for a few more seconds. He crushed the printout of websites visited by  \\nBakshi and put it in his pocket.\\n‘Thank you, Sir,’ Esha said.\\n‘You’re welcome. As you know, I am an ever-approachable manager.  \\nHere or Boston, you can reach me anytime.’\\nWe were at the door when Priyanka asked a question.\\n‘Sir, are you going to Boston soon/’\\nBakshi was back at his desk. He had picked up the telephone but paused  \\nwhen he heard Priyanka’s question. ‘Oh yes, I need to tell you about that. Not  \\nthat it’s very important. I am transferring to Boston soon. Maybe in a month  \\nor so.’\\n‘Transferring to Boston?’ Vroom, Radhika, Esha, Priyanka and I all spoke  \\ntogether.\\n‘Yes. You see I do not like to blow my own trumpet. But looks like they  \\nrecognized  my  contribution  in  the  value-addition  cycle  of  the  company,’  \\nBakshi said, a smug smile sliming across his shiny face. I though of toppling the  \\nentire bookshelf on his head.\\n‘But details will come later. Anyway, if you do not mind, I need to make  \\na call. I’ll keep you posted later if we have more news.’\\nBakshi signaled us to shut the door as we left. As I closed the door, I felt  \\nlike somehow had slapped my face. In slow motion, we walked away from his  \\noffice.#25\\nWe returned to WASG after our meeting with Bakshi. Calls flashed on  \\nthe screen, but no one attended to them. I sat at my seat and opened my  \\nemail. I could not read anything as my mind was having a systems overload.\\nI looked at the time, it was 2.45 a.m.\\nVroom sat at his desk and mumbled inaudible courses. He opened the  \\ninternal web page of Connexions on his computer. it had the map of the US on  \\nit. He held up a pen and tapped at a point on the US east coast. \\n‘This, this is Boston,’ he said and clenched his fist tight around the pen.  \\n‘This is where or boss will be while we are on the road looking for jobs.’\\nEveryone stayed quiet.\\n‘Can I ask why everyone is so bloody quiet?’ Vroom said.\\n‘I think we should start picking up some calls,’ I said started fumbling  \\nwith the controls on the telephone.\\n‘Like fuck we should,’ Vroom said and jabbed his pen hard on the  \\nmonitor. A loud ping startled everyone on the desk. Shattered glass made a  \\nnine-inch  wide,  spider-web  pattern  on  Vroom’s  monitor.  The  rest  of  his  \\nscreen worked as if nothing had happened.\\n‘What happened,’ the girls said and came around to Vroom’s computer.\\n‘Damn it,’ Vroom said and threw his pen hard on the ground. It broke  \\ninto two pieces. Some people break into tears when they are upset. Some  \\nbreak whatever is around them.\\n‘Oh no. the monitor is totally gone,’ Esha said. She put her hand on  \\nVroom’s shoulder, ‘Are you okay?’\\n‘Don’t you dare touch me, you slut,’ Vroom said and pushed her hand  \\naway.\\n‘What?’ Esha said. ‘What did you just said?’\\n‘Nothing.  Just  leave  me  alone,  al  right?  Go  pray  for  your  jobs  or  \\nwhatever. Bloody bitch on her way to becoming a hooker,’ Vroom said and  \\nmoved his chair away from Esha.\\nFor a few seconds the girls stood there, stunned. Then, slowly, they  \\nwalked back to their seats.\\n‘What’s wrong with him?’ Priyanka asked Esha in a whisper, which was  \\naudible to us.\\n‘I told you he proposed again. Maybe he’s not taking my rejection so  \\nwell,’ Esha said to Priyanka.\\n‘Oh really?’ Vroom shouted and stood up. ‘You think this is about the  \\nproposal? Like I don not know about your escapades. Everyone here knows it—\\nShyam, Radhika and Priyanka. You thought I would not find out? I wish I’d  \\nknown before I proposed to a certified slut who’ll bang for bucks. I feel sick.’\\nEsha looked at all of us, shocked. Tears appeared in her eyes. She  \\nstarted shaking, and Radhika helped her sit down. It is way more elegant to  \\ncry sitting down than standing up.Priyanka went up to Vroom’s seat. She stared at him, her face red. Slap!  \\nShe deposited a hard slap across Vroom’s face.\\n‘Learn how to talk to women you say one more nasty thing and I’ll screw  \\nyour happiness, understand?’ Priyanka said. \\nVroom stared at Priyanka, his hand over his cheek. He was too stunned  \\nto retaliate. I inserted myself between the two of them. Guys, can we have  \\nsome peace here,’ I said. ‘Things are already quite messed up. Please let’s sit  \\ndown and do some work.’\\n‘I can’t work. I don’t know if I’ll  still have a job in a few hours,’  \\nPriyanka said and moved back to her seat. She continued to flare at Vroom.\\n‘At least sit down,’ I said.\\n‘I want him to apologize to Esha. The idiot has to watch what he is  \\nsaying,’ Priyanka said.\\nEsha continued to cry as Radhika tried to console her.\\n‘What do you care about a job? You are getting married Women have it  \\neasy,’ Vroom said.\\nWhat?  Don’t  you  start  that  with  me  now,’  Priyanka  said.  She  had  \\nreached her seat but refused to sit down. ‘You think this is easy?’ she pointed  \\na finger to Esha and Radhika.\\nVroom kept quiet and looked down.\\n‘Radhika found out her husband is cheating on her. This when she works  \\nfor him and his family day and night. And Esha can’t get a fair break unless  \\nshe sleeps past creepy men. But they are not breaking monitors and shouting  \\ncurses, Vroom. Just because we don’t make a noise doesn’t mean it is easy,’  \\nshe said, shouting loud enough so you could call it noise.\\n‘Can we not talk for two minutes. Do not take calls. But at least keep  \\nquiet,’ I pleaded. \\nEsha stopped crying as Radhika gave her a glass of water. Priyanka sat  \\ndown and opened her handmade calendar. Vroom became quiet as he looked  \\nat the shattered bits of glass on his desk.\\nThe silence gave me a chance to reflect on Bakshi’s meeting. If I lost my \\njob, what would I do? Become an agent again?  I could probably forget about  \\nbeing a team leader.\\n‘I’m sorry,’ Vroom said.\\n‘What?’ Esha said.\\n‘I’m sorry, Esha,’ Vroom said, clearing his throat. ‘I said horrible and  \\nhurtful things. I was disturbed myself. Please forgive me.’\\n‘It’s okay Vroom. It only hurts because there is a bit of truth in it,’ Esha  \\nsaid with a wry smile.\\n‘I meant to say those horrible things to myself. Because,’ Vroom said  \\nand banged two fists simultaneously on the table, ‘because the real hooker is  \\nme, not you.’\\n‘What?’ I said.\\n‘Yes, this salary has hooked me. Every night I come here and let people  \\nfuck me,’ Vroom said and picked up the telephone headset. ‘The Americans  \\nfuck me with this, in my ears hundreds of times a night. Bakshi fucks me with  his management theories, backstabbing and threats to fire us. And the funny  \\nthing is, I let them do it. For money, for security—I let it happen. Come fuck  \\nme some more,’ Vroom said and threw the headset on the table. \\n‘Do you want water?’ Radhika said and handed him a glass of water.\\nVroom took the glass and drank the water in one gulp. I wondered if he  \\nwould throw the empty glass on the floor and shatter it to pieces. Luckily, he  \\njust banged it on the table.\\n‘Thanks,’ Vroom said. ‘I needed that. In fact, I need a break. Otherwise  \\nI’ll go mad. I can’t take this right now.’\\n‘I need a break too,’ Priyanka said. ‘It’s all right Vroom. Only a few  \\nmore hours left for the shift to get over.’\\n‘No. I want a break now. I want to go for a drive. C’mon people, let’s all  \\ngo for a drive. I’ll get the Qualis,’ Vroom said and stood up.\\n‘Now? It is close to 3 a.m.,’ I said.\\n‘Yes, now. Who gives a damn about the calls? You may not even have a  \\njob. Get up.’\\n‘Actually, if someone is going, can you please get some pills for me from  \\nthe 24-hours chemist/’ Radhika said.\\n‘No, all  of us are going,’ Vroom said. ‘Get up Shyam.  If you come  \\neveryone will come.’\\n‘I’m game,’ Esha said.\\n‘Okay, I’ll come too. Just for a bit of fresh air,’ Priyanka said. \\nI looked at them. Everyone wanted to get out of his or her miseries, if  \\nonly for a few moments. I wanted to get away from Bakshi, Ganesh and  \\nConnexions.\\n‘Okay, we can go. But we have to be back soon,’ I said.\\n‘Where are we going?’ Esha said, ‘I heard the new lounge bar Bed is  \\nclose by.’\\n‘No way, we’re just going for a drive…’ I said, but Vroom interrupted  \\nme.\\n‘Great idea. We are going to Bed—damn cool place.’\\n‘I need a real bed to sleep,’ Radhika said and stretched her arms.\\nAll of us got up. We decided to leave individually to prevent suspicions.\\n‘Get up, Military Uncle,’ Vroom said, as he went to his desk.\\n‘Huh?’ Uncle said getting up. Normally he would have scoffed at Vroom,  \\nbut I guess he was in too much pain over his son’s email to give a conscious  \\nreaction.\\n‘We’re all going for a drive. The others will tell you everything. I’ll get  \\nthe Qualis,’ Vroom said and switched off Uncle’s monitor.#26\\nAt 3:00 A.M. share we were outside the main entrance of Connexions. A  \\nwhite Qualis cam up and halted near us.\\n‘Get in,’ Vroom said, reaching over to open the doors.\\n‘It’s so cold. What took you so long,’ Esha said, getting into the front.\\n‘You try shifting a sound-asleep driver to another Qualis,’ Vroom said.\\nRadhika, Priyanka and I took the middle row; Military Uncle preferred to  \\nsit by himself at the back. He looked slightly dazed. May be we all did.\\nVroom  drove  prove  past  the  executive  parking  area  as  we  left  \\nConnexions. We saw Bakshi’s white Mitsubishi Lancer.\\n‘Bakshi’s got a flash car,’ Esha said.\\n‘Company paid, or course,’ Priyanka said.\\nVroom inched the Qualis forward and stopped close to the lancer. He  \\nswitched on the Qualis headlights. Bakshi’s car shone bright.\\n‘Can I ask a question? What’s the punishment for running people over?  \\nVroom said.\\n‘Excuse me?’ I said.\\n‘What is we ran this Qualis over Bakshi? We could do it when he comes  \\nto pick up his car in the morning. How many years of jail are we talking?’  \\nVroom said.\\nIt was a silly conversation, but Priyanka led him on anyway. \\n‘Depends on how the court sees it. If they see it as an accident and not  \\nas homicide or murder, about to years,’ she said.\\nVroom restarted the car and turned towards the exit gates.\\n‘Two years is not a lot. Can we divide it among the six of us? Four  \\nmonths each?’ Vroom said.\\n‘I don’t know. Ask a lawyer,’ Priyanka shrugged.\\n‘Four months is like nothing to get rid of Bakshi from this earth,’ Esha  \\nblew a strand of hair that had fallen against her lips.\\n‘Just sixteen weekends of sacrifice. Weekdays are like jail anyway,’  \\nVroom said. ‘What say we do it?’\\nBy now we had left the call center and were now on the highway. Apart  \\nfrom a few trucks, the roads were empty India has a billion people, but at  \\nnight, ninety-nine percent of them are fast asleep. This land then belongs to a  \\nchosen few: truck drivers, later shift workers, doctors, hostel staff and call  \\ncenter agents. We, the nocturnal, rule the roads and the country. Vroom  \\naccelerated the Qualis to eighty kilometers and hour.\\n‘I doubt you can split the punishment. ‘The driver gets the full deal,’  \\nPriyanka said, still on the stupid Bakshi-homicide topic, ‘plus if they know it’s  \\npremeditated, you are talking ten years plus.’\\n‘Hmmm. Now ten years is a totally different equation. What you say  \\nShyam, still not too bad to get rid of Bakshi?’\\n‘Okay, enough of this stupidity,’ I said. ‘I though you were taking us out  \\nof for a drink.’‘I’m just…’ Vroom said, raising one hand from the steering wheel.\\n‘Shut up and drive. I need a drink,’ I said.\\n‘Chemist first please. Can we please stop at a chemist,’ Radhika said,  \\ngiving herself a head massage.\\nWe dropped the topic of killing Bakshi. Though if the law allowed me on  \\ne free murder in my life, I am quite clear who will top the list. No wait, I am  \\nforgetting my ex-girlfriend’s mom here. I really wouldn’t know whom to kill  \\nfirst, that’s the truth. Perhaps the law would see me as a special case and  \\nallow me two murders.\\nVroom took a sharp right turn on to a road that led to a 24-hours  \\nchemist.\\nRadhika was quiet as she waited. I guess Payal occupied half her mind;  \\nthe other half had migraine.\\n‘There it is,’ Esha said, as we sighted a neon red cross.\\n‘Trust me. I know this area,’ Vroom said and accelerated the Qualis to a  \\nhundred. ‘Man, roads and girls are so much more fun at night.’\\n‘That’s sick,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Sorry, couldn’t help it,’ Vroom said and grinned.\\nVroom parked the Qualis near the chemist. A sleepy boy, no more than  \\nseventeen, manned the medicine shop. A few medical entrance exam guides  \\nlay on the counter in front of him. A fly swatter served the function of a  \\nbookmark. He looked bored and grateful to see us, more for the company,  \\nprobably, than the business.\\nVroom and Radhika got out of the Qualis. I stepped out to stretch my  \\nlegs as well.\\nRadhika walked quickly upto the boy.\\n‘What do you want, Radhika? Saridon?’ Vroom said as we reached the  \\ncounter.\\n‘No,’ she shook her head. Turning to the boy, she said. ‘Three strips of  \\nFluoxetine, and five strips each of Sertraline and Paroxetine. Make it fast  \\nplease.’ She began to tap on the counter anxiously. Her reed bangles jingled a  \\nlittle.\\nThe boy gaped at Radhika. Then he turned around and started rifling  \\nthrough the shelves.\\nVroom and I moved a few steps away of escape the smell of medicine.  \\nVroom lit a cigarette and we shared a few puffs.\\nThe  boy  returned  with  a  stack  of  tablets  and  placed  them  on  the  \\ncounter. Radhika reached out to grab them, but he put his right hand on top  \\nof the pile of medicines and slid them away from her. ‘This is pretty strong  \\nstuff, madam. You have a prescription?’ he asked.\\n‘It’s three in the morning,’ Radhika said in an irritated voice. ‘I ran out  \\nof pills at work. Where the hell do you except me to find a prescription?’\\n‘Sorry madam. Just that sometimes these young kids come here to pick  \\nup strange medicines before going to discos…’\\n‘Look  at  me,  Radhika  said,  pointing  to  her  face,  ‘do  I  look  like  a  \\nteenager in a mood to party?’No, Radhika did not look like a teenager out to party to me—she looked  \\nill, with dark circles under her eyes. I wished the boy would give her the  \\nmedicines soon.\\n‘But these are still a lot of strong medicines, madam. What do you need  \\nthese for? I mean, what is wrong with you?’ the boy said.\\n‘Fuck you,’ Radhika said and banged her fist hard on the glass counter.  \\nThe  glass  shook  but  survived  the  impact.  However  two  of  Radhika’s  red  \\nbangles broke into a million pieces. Shattered bits of bright glass scattered  \\nalong the counter.\\nThe noise scared the boy; he jumped back two steps. Vroom crushed his  \\ncigarette and we joined them at the counter.\\n‘Excuse me, madam,’ the boy said.\\n‘Fuck you. You want to know what is wrong with me? You little punk,  \\nyou want to know what is wrong with me?’\\n‘What’s up Radhika, everything okay?’ Vroom said.\\n‘This dumbass wants to know what is wrong with me,’ Radhika said,  \\npointing her fingers at the boy. ‘Who the hell is he? What does he know about  \\nme?’\\n’Calm down Radhika,’ I said, but she probably did not even hear me.  \\nThat is the story of my life; half the things I say go unnoticed.\\n‘What does he know about wrong and right? Everything is wrong with  \\nme you moron—my husband is banging some bitch while I slog my guts out.  \\nHappy now?’ Radhika said, her face more red than her broken bangles. She  \\nheld her head for a few seconds. Then she removed her hands from her head  \\nand grabbed the medicines. The boy at the counter did not protest this time.\\n‘Water. Can I have some water?’ Radhika said.\\nThe boy ran inside his shop returned with a glass of water.\\nRadhika tore a few pills out of her new stack. One, two, three—I think  \\nshe popped in three of them. Some migraine cure this was, I thought.\\n‘Four  hundred  sixty  three  rupees, madam,’ the boy  said,  his voice  \\ntrembling with fear.\\n‘I am alive because of this stuff. I need it to survive, not to party,’  \\nRadhika said.\\nShe paid for the medicines and walked back to the Qualis. Vroom and I  \\nfollowed a few steps behind her.\\n‘What medicine is that?’ I said.\\n‘What the hell do I know? I am no doctor,’ Vroom said.\\n‘You sure she has a prescription for those/’ I said.\\n‘Ask her, if you have the guts,’ Vroom said.\\n‘No way. Let’s get to the lounge bar soon.’\\n‘Everything  okay?’  Esha  said  as  we  got  into  the  Qualis.  ‘We  heard  \\narguments.’\\n‘Nothing. As Bakshi would say, we just had some communication issues.  \\nBut now, let’s put them to Bed,’ Vroom said and turned the Qualis around.\\nRadhika put the medicines in her bag. Her face was calmer as the three  \\npills started to kick in.Vroom pushed the Qualis to one hundred and ten, the maximum it  \\nwould go without the engine crying for mercy. \\n‘Slow down Vroom,’ Esha said.\\n‘Don’t use the words slow and Vroom in one sentence, Vroom said.\\n‘Dialogue,’ I said, ‘should we clap/’\\n A  truck  stuffed  with  bags  of  hay  loped  past  us  like  an  inelegant  \\nelephant. Our headlights made the gunny bags glow in the dark.\\n‘See, even the truck was going faster than us. I am a safe driver,’ Vroom  \\nsaid.\\n‘Sorry guys,’ Radhika said, her voice becoming more normal as the drugs  \\ntook effect. ‘I apologize for creating a scene there.’\\n‘What did you buy Radhika? Why did the chemist make a fuss?’ I said,  \\nunable to control my curiosity.\\n‘Anti-depressants.  Chemists  ask  questions,  as  they’re  prescription  \\ndrugs. But most of the time they don’t care.’\\n‘Wow! Vroom said. ‘You mean happy drugs like Prozac and stuff.’\\n‘Yes, Flueoxetine is Prozac. Except it is the Indian version, so a lot  \\ncheaper.’\\n‘Like all of us,’ Vroom said and laughed at his own joke.\\n‘But it’s dangerous to take it without medical supervision,’ Priyanka  \\nsaid. ‘Isn’t it addictive?’\\n‘It’s legal addiction. I can’t live without it and, yes, it’s is really bad for  \\nyou. But it is still better than having to face my life,’ Radhika said.\\n‘Leave it Radhika—they will harm you,’ Military Uncle spoke for the first  \\ntime on our drive.\\n‘I had cut down, Military Uncle. But sometimes one needs a bigger dose.  \\nCan everyone please switch to another topic? How far is this Bed?’\\n‘just two kilometers from here. Ninety seconds if I am driving, a lot  \\nmore his comment, as I preferred for him to keep his eyes on the road. Some  \\ninebriated truckies drove past as Vroom dodged them. \\n‘I heard the Bed is really snooty,’ Priyanka said. ‘I’m not dressed at all.’  \\nShe adjusted her salwar kameez. I noticed the border of glittering stone-work  \\non her dark green chiffon dupatta.\\n‘You look fine,’ Esha reassured her, ‘the chiffon look is really in. I  \\nshould be worried. I look so grungy.’\\n‘Don’t worry Esha. Anyone with a navel rings to never denied entry in a  \\ndisco,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Well, if you girls are in doubt, they definitely won’t let in a boring  \\nhousewife like me,’ Radhika said.\\n‘Don’t  worry.  As  long  as  we’re  ready  to  spend  cash,  we  will  be  \\nwelcome. Plus, the DJ at Bed is my classmate from school,’ Vroom said.\\n‘All you school classmates have such funky jobs,’ I said.\\n‘Well, that is the problem. They all have rich dads. I have to work hard  \\nto match their lifestyle. If only my rich dad didn’t have to leave us,’ Vroom  \\nsaid. ‘Anyway guys, welcome to Bed. And courtesy your humble driver, it is  just 3:23 a.m. He flashed the headlights at a sign. It said ‘Bed Lounge and  \\nBarr: Your Personal Space’.\\n‘Oh no, didn’t realize we’re there already,’ Esha said. She fished out a  \\nmirror from her purse and examined her lips. How did women manage before  \\nmirror were invented?\\n‘How is my hair? It is awful as usual?’ Priyanka said to Radhika.\\nI looked at her long curly hair. Priyanka always said how she had the  \\n‘most boring fair in the world’, and how could’ do nothing with it’. I felt the  \\nurge to run my fingers through it just as I had done a hundreds times before.  \\nBut I couldn’t, as someone called Ganesh would be doing it for me in a few  \\nweeks’ time. The oil for the Mc Donald’s French fries started simmering again  \\nin my gut. What is the oil they use at McDonald’s anyway? It burns like hell.\\n‘Your hair is perfect. Anyway, it’ll be dark inside. Let’s go,’ Radhika  \\nsaid. ‘C’mon Military Uncle, we’re going inside.’#27\\nWe followed Vroom to a huge black door, the entrance of Bed. The door  \\nwas painted so that it merged with the wall. An ultra beefy bounder and a  \\nmalnourished woman stood besides it.\\n‘Are you a member, sir?’ the malnourished woman addressed Vroom.  \\nShe was the hostess (or door-bitch), according to Priyanka) and wore a black  \\ndress. She was about five feet four inches, but looked way taller because of  \\nher thin frame and heels the size of a coke bottle.\\n‘So, we’ve just come for a quick drink,’ Vroom said and took out his  \\ncredit card. ‘Here, you can open the tab on this.’\\n‘I’m sorry sir, tonight is for members only,’ she said. The beefy bouncer  \\nlooked at us with a black, daft glare. Like Bakshi, he belonged to the non-\\nhuman species of mankind.\\n‘How do you become a member?’ I said.\\n‘You have to fill a form and pay the annual membership fee of fifty  \\nthousand,’ the hostess said, as calmly as if she’d asked us for small change.\\n‘What? Fifty grand for this place in the middle of nowhere?’ Priyanka  \\nsaid and pointed her finger to the door. She had draped her dupatta in  \\nreverse, in an attempt to look hip.\\n‘I suggest you go somewhere else then,’ the hostess said. She looked at  \\nPriyanka scornfully. A fully-clad female is a no-no at disco.\\n‘Don’t you look at me like that,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Hey cool it, Priyanka, Vroom said and turned to the bouncer. ‘What’s  \\nthe deal, dude. Is DJ Jas inside? I know him.’\\n‘Huh…what…’ the bouncer said with a dumb, nervous expression. It was  \\nthe most challenging question anyone had asked him in months.\\n‘You know Jas?’ the hostess said, her voice warmer now.\\n‘School buddy of seven years. Tell him Vroom is here,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Cool. Why didn’t you tell me that before, Vroom?’ the hostess said and  \\ngave Vroom a flirtatious smile. She bent over to release the velvet ropes. The  \\nskeletal structure of her upper torso was visible. If she broke a bone, she  \\nwouldn’t need an x-ray.\\n‘Can we go in now/’ Esha asked the hostess with a bored expression.\\n‘Yes. Though Vroom, next time, please tell you friends to dress up for  \\nBed,’ the hostess said and glanced meaningfully at Priyanka and Radhika.\\n‘I could wring her tiny neck, just like that. One twist and it will snap  \\nlike a chicken bone,’ Priyanka said.\\nAs we were in, the bouncer frisked Vroom and me. I finally understood  \\nthe purpose of his existence. After us, he went towards Priyanka. \\n‘What?’ I said to the bouncer.\\n‘I need to check this lady,’ he said. ‘She acts like she could cause  \\ntrouble.’ He towered over Priyanka, who just froze.\\nAnd then, I don’t know how, but the words came to me.\\n‘You’re not touching her, you understood,’ I said.The bouncer was startled. He turned to me. He had biceps the size of  \\nmy thighs, and deep inside I shuddered to think how much it would hurt if he  \\ndelivered a punch across my face.\\n‘What’s up now?’ the hostess came towards us.\\n‘Nothing, just teach your Tarzan out here how to behave with women,’ I  \\nsaid and pulled at Priyanka’s hand. In a second we were inside Bed.\\nWe chose a corner bed, which had two hookahs next to it.\\n‘Why is the hostess so mean?’ Esha said, as she hoisted herself onto the  \\nbed. She took two cushions to rest her elbows. ‘Did you hear her?’ “ Go \\nsomewhere else ”. Is that how you treat customers?’\\n‘It’s their job. They’re paid to be mean. It gives the place attitude,’  \\nVroom said carelessly as he lit up a hookah. I looked at the hot, smoldering  \\ncoals and thought of Ganesh. I don’t know why, I though it would be fun to  \\ndrop some down his pants.\\n‘I want a job that pays me to be mean. All they tell us in the call center  \\nis “be nice, be polite, be helpful”—being mean is so much more fun,’ Radhika  \\nsaid and reclined along a long cushion. For someone who had just had a really  \\nrough night she looked nice; although I’m not sure anymore can look ugly in  \\nultraviolet-candlelight anyway. I wondered how a moron called Anuj could  \\nleave her.\\nOnly Esha and Radhika got to lie down. The rest of us sat cross-legged  \\non the bed.\\nVroom went to say hi to DJ Jas, who was playing some incomprehensible  \\nFrench-African-Indian fusion music. He returned with twelve kamikaze shots.  \\nMilitary Uncle declined, and we didn’t protest as it meant more alcohol for us.  \\nVroom took Uncle’s extra shots and drank them in quick succession.\\nWe had barely finished our kamikazes when another thin woman (a Bed  \\nspecialty) came up to us with another six drinks.\\n‘Long Island ice Teas,’ she said, ‘courtesy DJ Jas.’\\n‘Nice. You have your friends in the right places,’ Radhika said as she  \\nstarted gulping her Long Island like it was a glass of water. When you don’t get  \\nto drink on a regular basis, you go crazy at the chance.\\n‘These Long Island are very stiff,’ I said after a few sips, I could feel my  \\nhead spin. ‘Easy guys,’ I said, ‘our shift isn’t over. We said one quick drink, so  \\nlet’s go back soon.’\\n‘Cool it man. Just one last drink,’ Vroom said as he ordered another set  \\nof cocktails.\\n‘I am getting high,’ Priyanka said. ‘I’m going to miss this. I am going to  \\nmiss you guys.’\\n‘Yeah right. We’ll see when you move to Seattle. Here guys, try this—it  \\nis apple flavour,’ Vroom said as he took a big drag from the hookah. He passed  \\nit around, and everyone (except Military Uncle, whose expression was growing  \\nmore resigned by the minute) took turns smoking it. DJ Jas’s music was  \\nmellow, which went well with the long drags we were taking from the hookah.\\nThere were two flat LCD screens in front of our bed, one tuned to MTV,  \\nand the other to CNN. A Bollywood item number was being played on MTV, as  part of its ‘Youth Special’ program. A girl stripped off successive items of her  \\nclothing as the song progressed. The breaking news on CNN was that the US  \\nconsidering going to war with Iraq again. I noticed Vroom staring at thee TV  \\nshowing CNN.\\n‘Americans are sick,’ Vroom said, as he pointed to a US politician who  \\nhad spoken out in support of the war. ‘Look at him. He would make the whole  \\nword if he could have his way.’\\n‘No, not the whole world. I don’t think they’d blow up China,’ Priyanka  \\nsaid, sounding high. ‘They need the cheap labor.’\\n‘Then I guess they won’t blow up Gurgaon either. They need the call  \\ncenters,’ Radhika said.\\n‘So we are safe,’ Esha said, ‘that’s’ good. Welcome to Gurgaon, the  \\nsafest city on earth.’\\nThe girls started laughing. Even Military Uncle smiled.\\n‘It’s not funny girls. Our government doesn’t realize this, but Americans  \\nare using us. We are sacrificing an entire generation to service their call  \\ncenters,’ Vroom said. Convincing me that one day he could be a politician.\\nNobody responded.\\n‘Don’t you agree/’ Vroom said.\\n‘Can you please stop this trip…’ I began. As usual, I was put on mute.\\n‘C’mon Vroom. Call centers are useful to us too,’ Esha said. ‘You know  \\nhow hard it is to make fifteen grand a month outside. And here we are, sitting  \\nin an air-conditioned office, talking on the phone, collecting our pay and  \\ngoing home. And it is the same for hundreds and thousands of young people.  \\nWhat’s wrong with that?’\\n‘An air-conditioned sweatshop is still a sweatshop. In fact, it is worse,  \\nbecause nobody sees the sweat. Nobody sees you brain getting rammed,’  \\nVroom said.\\n‘Then why don’t you quit? Why are you still here?’ I said. I hate it when  \\nhe ruins my high with his high ground.\\n‘Because I need the money. My friends have a lifestyle that I have to  \\nkeep up with. Money lets me come to places like this,’ Vroom said.\\n‘It’s just Bakshi. You are worked up about him and now you are blaming  \\nit on the call center,’ I said.\\n‘Screw Bakshi, he is not the only bad boss around. C’mon, the whole  \\nworld is being run by a bad, stupid-evil boss,’ he said, pointing to CNN. ‘Look  \\nat them, scared out of their guys, ready to bomb everyone. Meanwhile, all we  \\ndo it talk on the phone all night. White the world snores away,’ Vroom said. \\n‘Stop complaining about working at night. Doctors do it, hotel people do  \\nit, airplane pilots do it, factory workers—hell, even that does bitch works at  \\nnight,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘There is nothing wrong with working at night. And I agree the money is  \\ngood. But the difference is, we don’t have jobs that make up work to our  \\npotential. Look at our country, we are still so behind these Americans. Even  \\nwhen we know we are no less than them,’ Vroom said, gesturing wildly at the  \\nTV screen.‘So? What other kinds of jobs can there be,’ Esha said with a hairclip in  \\nher mouth. She had begun the ritual of untying and retying her hair.\\n‘So like, there is so much to do. We should be building roads, power  \\nplants, airports, phone networks and metro trains in every city like madness.  \\nAnd if the government moves its rear—end and does that, the young people in  \\nthis country will find jobs there. Hell, I would work days and nights for that—\\nas long as I know that what I am doing is helping build something for my  \\ncountry, for its future. But the government doesn’t believe in doing any real  \\nwork, so they allow these BPOs to e opened and think they have taken care of  \\nthe youth. Just a this stupid MTV thinks showing a demanded chick do a dance  \\nin her underwear will make the program a youth special. Do you think they  \\nreally care?’\\n‘Who?’ I said. ‘The government or MTV?’ I got up and signaled for the  \\ncheck (in bars you always ask for the ‘check’—never the ‘bill’). It was 3:50  \\na.m., and I had enough of Vroom’s lecture. I wanted tog get back to the call  \\ncenter soon. \\nVroom paid for the bill with his credit card and we promised to split the  \\ncosts later.\\n‘Both. Both of them don’t give a fuck,’ Vroom said as we left Bed.\\nThe door bitch and the bouncer gave us a puzzled looks we walked out.#28\\nVroom drove us out of Bed and we were soon back on the highway.  \\nEvery now and then the Qualis swayed to the left or right of the road.\\n‘Careful,’ Esha said, ‘you okay Vroom?’\\n‘I’m fine. Man, I love driving,’ Vroom said dreamily.\\n‘I can drive if you…’ I said.\\n‘I said I’m fine,’ Vroom said in a firm voice. A few minutes later, we  \\npassed by Sahara Mail, the biggest shopping mall in Gurgaon. Abruptly, Vroom  \\nbrought the Qualis to a halt.\\n‘I feel nauseous,’ Vroom said I think we were all feeling a little nauseous  \\nafter Vroom’s erratic driving.\\n‘Whatever you do, don’t throw up in the Qualis. The driver will kill  \\nyou,’ Esha said.\\nVroom  rested  his  head  on the  steering wheel. The  horn  blew  loud  \\nenough to wake up the street dogs.\\n‘Let’s take a walk Vroom,’ I said and tapped his shoulder. We got out of  \\nthe Qualis.\\nI made Vroom walk around the perimeter of the Sahara mall. We passed  \\nby several advertising hoardings showing all kinds of people: a couple all  \\nsmiles because they had just bought a toothbrush; a group of friends giggling  \\nover their mobile phones; a family happily feeding their kid junk food; a  \\nyoung graduate jumping with joy, clutching a credit card; a girl holding seven  \\nshopping bags and beaming. All the ads had one thing is common. Everyone  \\nlooked incredibly happy.\\n‘What the hell are they so happy about?’ Vroom said. ‘Look at that  \\ntoothbrush couple. My mom and dad, they are never that happy.’\\n‘Just  take  deep  breaths  and  walk  in  a  straight  line  Vroom.  You’re  \\ndrunk,’ I said.\\n‘I’m fine,’ he said, ‘but mom and dad…Shyam, why do they hate each  \\nother so much?’\\n‘Grown ups man, they are way more complicated than we are. Don’t  \\neven try figuring them out,’ I said.\\nVroom stopped walking and straightened up. He told me to pause as  \\nwell, and continued: ‘Think about this. The people who gave birth to me can’t  \\nstop hating each other enough. What does that tell you about me? Half my  \\ngenes must be fighting with the other half. No wonder I am so fucking messed  \\nup.’\\n‘We are all messed up man, let’s go,’ I said and prodded his shoulders.\\nHe walked faster to get a few steps ahead of me.\\nAt the corner of Sahara Mall we passed by a Pizza Hut. It was closed.  \\nVroom went up and stood in front of it. I wondered if he had really gone  \\ncrazy; was he expecting pizza at this time?\\nWe stood near the entrance. On our right, there was a thirty-foot wide  \\nmetal hoarding of a cola company. A top Bollywood actress held a drink bottle  and looked at us with inviting eyes. Like a fizzy drink was all it took to seduce  \\nher into bed.\\n Vroom walked close to the actress’s face.\\n‘What’s up dude/’ I said.\\n‘You see her?’ Vroom said, pointing to the actress.\\nI nodded.\\n‘There she is, looking at us like she is our best friend. Do you think she  \\ncares for us?’\\n‘I don’t know. She is a youth icon man,’ I shrugged my shoulders.\\n‘Yes, youth icon. This airhead chick is supposed to be out role model.  \\nLike she knows a fuck about life and gives a fuck about us. All she cares about  \\nis cash. She doesn’t care about you or me. She just wants you to buy this  \\nblack piss,’ Vroom said, pointing to the cola bottle.\\n‘Black piss?’ I said and smiled. I sat down on some steps nearby.\\n‘Do you know how much sugar there is in one of these drinks?’ Vroom  \\nsaid.\\nI shook my head.\\n‘Eight spoons of sugar in every bottle—and nothing else. And yet, they  \\nconvince us this is important. It isn’t.\\nVroom looked around and noticed a pile of bricks. He lifted one and  \\nthrew it hard at the cola hoarding. Bang! It hit the actress’s cheek, creating a  \\ndimple you would almost think was natural. She still kept smiling.\\n‘Careful, for fuck’s sake. Let’s go back. Someone will see us and get us  \\narrested.’\\n‘Like I care. Nobody cares,’ Vroom said and staggered towards me. I  \\nlooked at his lanky outline in the streetlights. ‘The government doesn’t care  \\nfor anybody,’ he continued. ‘Even that “youth special” channel, they don’t  \\ncare either. They say youth because they want the damn Pizza Huts and  \\nCokes and Pepsis of the world to come and give pizza and coke, we will be  \\nhappy. Like young people don’t have a fucking brain. Tell us what crap to  \\nhave and we’ll have it.’\\nVroom sat down in front of the Pizza Hut steps. ‘Shyam,’ he said. ‘I’m  \\ngoing to throw up.’\\n‘Oh no,’ I said and moved three feet way from him.\\n‘Unnh…’ Vroom said as he threw up. Puke spread around like a 12”-thin  \\ncrust pizza with gross toppings outside the entrance. \\n‘’Feeling better/’ I said as I carefully helped him up. Vroom nodded his  \\nhead.\\nHe stood up and jerked his shoulders free from me. He lifted another  \\nbrick. He hurled it high, and with one wide swing smashed it into the Pizza  \\nhut restaurant. Crash! A window shattered, and bits of glass fell down like a  \\nbeautiful ice fountain. An alarm began to ring.\\n‘Damn, Vroom have you gone mad?’ let’s get the hell out of here,’ I  \\nsaid.\\nVroom  was  startled  by  the  alarm  as  well,  and  his  body  sprang  to  \\nattention.‘Fuck, let’s run,’ Vroom said and we sprinted towards the Qualis.\\n‘I thought you liked pizza,’ I said when we reached the Qualis.\\n‘I like pizza. Damn well I do. I like jeans, mobiles and pizzas. I earn, I  \\neat, I buy shit and I die. That is all the fuck there is to Vroom. It is all, bullshit  \\nman,’ Vroom said, panting and holding his stomach. He didn’t look too good,  \\nbut at least the run seemed to have sobered him down.\\n‘Seriously dude, can I drive now?’ I said, as Vroom opened the front  \\ndoor of the Qualis. He was talking noisy, heavy breaths.\\n‘No way man,’ Vroom said and pushed me away.\\nThe car jerked ahead as Vroom turned on the ignition while in gear.\\n‘Are you okay/’ Esha said.\\nVroom nodded and raised his hand in apology. He waited for a few  \\nseconds, and then started the engine carefully. He promised to drive slow and  \\nsoon we were on the road again.\\n‘You  liked  Bed?’  Vroom  said,  more  to  change  the  topic  from  his  \\ninebriated state.\\n‘Great place,’ Esha said, ‘just the kind of high I needed. Hey Vroom,  \\nhave you kept any music in the Qualis?’\\n‘Of course. Let me see,’ Vroom said and shuffled through the glove box.  \\nHe took out a tape and held it up. ‘Musafir lounge?’ he said.\\n‘Cool,’ Esha and Radhika said.\\n‘NO,’ Priyanka and I said at the same time.\\n‘C’mon guys. You two not only hate each other, you hate the same  \\nthings too?’ Vroom said and smiled. He put the tape in and turned on the  \\nmusic. A song called Rabba started playing.\\nWe sat in the same order as before. Except this time I sat next to  \\nPriyanka. With every beat of the song, I could feel her body along my entire  \\nright side, like soft electric sparks. I had the urge to grab her hand again, but  \\nrestrained myself. I opened the window for some fresh air.\\n‘Don’t open the window,’ Esha said, ‘it is so cold.’\\n‘Just for a minute,’ I said and let the breeze in.\\nI focused on the lyrics of the song. The singer spoke of why no beloved  \\nshould ever enter his life. That if one did, she should damn well stay and  \\nnever leave. Somehow the lyrics were too close to heart. However, I was  \\nmore worried about the next song. It was Mahi Ve—which would bring back  \\nmemories of the 32nd Milestone parking lot.\\nI saw Priyanka’s face change from the corner of my eye. She looked  \\nnervous in anticipation too. Yes, this was going to be hard.\\n‘I love this song,’ Vroom declared, as the song I was dreading filled the  \\nQualis.\\nThe lyric hit my ears and I pressed the rewind-and-play button in the  \\nprivacy  of  my  head.  Every  moment  of  32nd Milestone  replayed  itself.  I  \\nremembered how Priyanka sat on my lap, stubbed my toe and hit her head on  \\nthe roof. I recalled every little second of her careful, slow and yet amazing  \\nlovemaking. I missed her breath on my stubble, her eyes when they looked  \\ninto mine, the pleasurable pain when she bit my ears. What is it about music  that it makes you remember things you prefer to forget ? I wished I had got  \\npromoted. I wished Priyanka had never left me. I wished my world were a  \\nhappier place.\\nI turned my face to look outside. The breeze felt cold, particularly along  \\ntwo lines on my cheeks. I touched my face. Damn, I couldn’t believe I was  \\ncrying.\\n‘Can we please close the window now? It’s ruining my hair,’ Esha said.\\nI slid the window shut. I tried to keep my eyes shut as well, but I  \\ncouldn’t  as  tears  wanted  to  come  out.  I  didn’t  know  I  was  such  an  \\nembarrassing wuss.\\nI looked at Priyanka. Maybe it was my imagination, but her eyes seemed  \\nwet too. She turned towards me and then quickly looked away. I couldn’t  \\nbear to meet her eyes right now. And I certainly could not look at that nose.\\nVroom pulled out two tissues from the tissue box in front and swung his  \\narm back to hand them over to us.\\n‘What?’ I said.\\n‘There is rear–view mirror. I can see,’ he said.\\n‘We all can see,’ Radhika and Esha said together and burst out laughing.\\n‘You keep driving alright,’ I said. I took the tissue, and on the pretext of  \\nwiping my nose, wiped my eyes. Priyanka took one and swabbed her eyes as  \\nwell.\\nEsha reached behind from her seat and rubbed Priyanka’s arm.\\n‘You guys are funny. Remind me again how you met in college?’ Vroom  \\nsaid.\\n‘Forget it,’ I said.\\n‘C’mon Shyam, just ell. You guys never told me,’ Radhika said.\\n‘At the campus fair,’ Priyanka said I spoke at the same time.\\nI looked at her. We gave each other a formal smile.\\n‘You tell,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘No, it’s okay. You say is better,’ I said.\\nPriyanka sat up straight to tell a story we had told a hundred times, but  \\nnever got tired of repeating.\\n‘We met at the campus fair in second year. Both of us had stalls. Mine  \\nwas on female empowerment. It showed slides of problems faced by rural  \\nwomen in India. Shyam had a video games counter. However, nobody was  \\ncoming to visit either of us—everyone just wanted to go to the food stalls.’\\n‘Then?’ Esha said, her eyes focused on Priyanka.\\nThen Shyam and I made a deal that we would visit each other’s stalls six  \\ntimes a day. Shyam would come and see slides on hardworking farm, women  \\nand  female  education  programs.  I  would  go  and  play  Doom  II  on  the  \\nPlaystation at his stall. By the end of the fair I was so good, I could beat him,’  \\nPriyanka said.\\n‘No way,’ I said. ‘I can take you on at Doom II any day.’\\n‘Well, anyway—so over three days we visited each other’s stalls three  \\ndozen times. And by the end of it, we felt…’ Priyanka said and paused.\\n‘What?’ Radhika said.‘We felt that both the stalls belonged to us. And that as long as we were  \\ntogether, we didn’t need anyone else to visit,’ Priyanka said and her voice  \\nchoked up.\\nMy throat already had a lump the size of an orange, and I just nodded to  \\nkeep a straight expression.\\nWe kept silent. I was hoping Priyanka would cry big time now.\\n‘Well, things change. Life goes on—move on to better things. It is like  \\nplaystation to X-box,’ Vroom said.\\nI hate Vroom. Just when Priyanka was all mellow, Vroom’s wise words  \\nbrought her back to reality. She composed herself and changed the topic.\\n‘How far are we?’ Priyanka said.\\nI looked at my watch.\\n‘Damn Vroom, it is past 4 a.m. How much further?’\\n‘Around five kilometers from the call center. I am driving slower now.  \\nYou want  me to drive faster?’\\n‘No,’ all of us cried.\\n‘We’re going to get late. Bakshi will flip out,’ I said.\\n‘I can take a shortcut,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Shortcut/’ I said.\\n‘Next left there is an un-tarred road. It was made for construction  \\nprojects. It cuts through some fields—saves us about two kilometers.’\\n‘Is the road lit up?’ Esha said.\\n‘No, but we have headlights. I’ve used that way before. Let’s take it,’  \\nVroom said.\\nVroom took a sharp left after a kilometer.\\n‘Ouch,’ Esha said, ‘you didn’t tell us this road will be so bumpy.’\\n‘Just a few minutes,’ Vroom said. ‘actually the ground is wet today from  \\nthe rains yesterday. That is why the ride is not smooth.’\\nWe plunged on into the darkness, even as the headlights tried hard to  \\nshow us the way. We passed fields and construction sites filled with materials  \\nlike cement, bricks and iron rods. In a few places, there were deep holes, at  \\nbuilders constructed the foundation for super-high rise apartments. I think  \\nthe whole of Delhi had decided to move to Gurgaon, and people were growing  \\nhomes along with the crops.\\n‘There, just one final cut and we are back on the highway,’ Vroom said  \\ntaking a sharp right.\\nSuddenly  the  Qualis  skidded.  The  vehicle  rattled  and  slid  down  an  \\ninclined path.\\n‘Careful,’ everyone shouted and held on to anything that they could  \\nfind around them. The Qualis went off the road into a slushy downhill patch.  \\nVroom desperately tried to control the steering but the wheels couldn’t grip  \\nthe ground. Like a drunk tramp, the Qualis staggered down and into the site  \\nof a high-rise construction project.#29\\nThe slope ended but the Qualis still kept rolling forward. It slowed down  \\nas it slid onto a mesh of iron construction rods. Vroom braked hard, and the  \\nQualis halted on the rods with a metallic clang, bounced twice and came to a  \\nstop.\\n‘Damn,’ Vroom said.\\nEveryone sat in shocked silence.\\n‘Don’t worry guys,’ vroom said and started the ignition. The Qualis  \\nshook with wild vibrations.\\n‘Shut…the…ignition…Vroom…’ I said. I looked under the Qualis. There  \\nwas a floor of iron below us that was trembling violently.\\nVroom’s hands trembled too as he turned the engine off. I think my  \\nremaining alcohol in his body had evaporated in seconds.\\n‘Where are we?’ Esha said and opened the window. She looked out and  \\nscreamed, ‘Oh no!’\\n‘What?’ I said and looked out again. This time I looked around more  \\ncarefully. What I saw was scary: we had landed in the foundation hole of a  \\nbuilding, which had a frame of exposed metal rods covering it. The foundation  \\nwas a pit, probably fifty-feet deep and had a frame of reinforced cement  \\nconcrete rods above it. The rods were parallel to the Qualis and jutting out at  \\nthe other end—and they were all that supported us. Every time we moved,  \\nthe  Qualis  bounced,  as  the  rods  acted  as  springs.  I  could  see  fear  in  \\neveryone’s face, including Military Uncle’s.\\n‘We’re  hanging  above  a  hole,  supported  only  by  toothpicks.  We’re  \\nscrewed,’ Radhika said, summing up the situation for all of us.\\n‘What are we going to do?’ Esha said. The contagious panic in her voice  \\nmade everyone nervous.\\n‘Whatever you do, don’t move,’ Vroom said.\\nA few minutes passed. The heavy breathing of six people was the only  \\nsound.\\n‘Should we call for help? The police? Fire brigade? Call center?’ Esha  \\nsaid as she took out her mobile phone from her bag.\\nVroom nodded. His face had the nakedness of fear.\\n‘Damn, no reception,’ Esha said. ‘Does anyone else have a mobile that  \\nworks?’\\nPriyanka and Radhika’s cell phones did not work as well. Military Uncle  \\ndidn’t have a mobile. Vroom took out his phone. \\n‘No network,’ he said.\\nI took out my phone from my pocket and gave it to Esha. \\n‘Your phone is also not working, Shyam,’ Esha said and placed it on the  \\ndashboard.\\n‘So we can’t reach anyone in this world?’ Radhika said.\\nA rod snapped under us. The Qualis tilted a few degrees to the right.  \\nRadhika fell towards me; Vroom held the steering wheel tight to keep his  balance. He froze in the driver’s seat, unable to think of what else to do.  \\nAnother rod snapped, and then another like feeble twigs under us. The Qualis  \\ntilted around thirty degrees and came to a halt.\\nAll of us were too scared to scream.\\n‘Dows anyone have any ideas?’ Vroom said.\\nI closed my eyes for a second. I visualized my death. My life could end,  \\njust like this in oblivion. I wondered when and how people wound find us. May  \\nbe labors tomorrow or even after a couple of days.\\n‘Six irresponsible agents found dead, alcohol in body’ would be the  \\nheadline.\\n‘Try to open the door, Vroom,’ Military Uncle said.\\nVroom  opened  his  door.  The  Qualis  wobbled  and  Vroom  shut  it  \\nimmediately.\\n‘Can’t, Vroom said. ‘Messes up the balance. And what’s the point? We  \\ncan’t step out, we would fall right through.’\\nI turned around to look out from rear window. I noticed bushes a few  \\nfeet behind us.\\n‘Move  towards  the  left.  No  weight  on  the  right.  We  have  to  stay  \\nbalanced until someone spots us in the morning,’ Vroom said.\\nI checked my watch. It was only 4:14 a.m. Morning was three hours  \\naway. A lifetime. And people could show up even later.\\n‘Otherwise?’ Esha said.\\n‘Otherwise we die,’ Vroom said.\\nWe stayed quiet for a minute.\\n‘Everyone dies on day,’ I said, just to break the silence.\\n‘Maybe it is simpler this way. Just end life rather than deal with it,’  \\nVroom said.\\nI nodded. I was nervous and I was glad Vroom was making small talk.\\n‘My main question is– what if no one finds us even after we die. What  \\nhappens then?’ Vroom said.\\n‘The  vultures  will  find  us.  They  always  do.  I  saw  it  on  Discovery  \\nChannel,’ I said.\\n‘See, that makes me uncomfortable. I don’t like the idea of sharp beaks  \\nrearing my muscles, cracking my bones and ripping me to shreds. Plus, my  \\nbody will be smelling like hell. I’d rather be burnt in a dignified manner and  \\ngo up in that one last ultimate puff of smoke.’\\n‘Can you guys stop this nonsense? At least be silent,’ Esha said and  \\nfolded her arms.\\nVroom smiled at her. Then he turned to me. “I don’t thinking Esha will  \\nsmell too much. Her Calvin Klein perfume will keep her carcass fresh for  \\ndays.’\\nBeneath us, there were two sharp ‘pings’ as two more rods snapped.\\n‘Oh no,’ Priyanka said we heard another ping right below her. A flicker  \\nof light appeared at the dashboard.\\nEveryone sprang to attention as my cell phone began vibrating.\\n‘That’s my phone,’ I said.The phone started ringing. Everyone’s mouth hung open.\\n‘How did this ring without a network?’ Esha said, her voice nervous.\\n‘Who is it,’ Radhika said.\\n‘Pick it up,’ I said with my hand stretched out, unable to reach the  \\ndashboard and unwilling to move too much.\\nEsha lifted the phone. She looked at the screen and gasped.\\n‘Who is it?’ I said.\\n‘Do you know someone called…God? It says…Good calling,’ Esha said.#30\\nEsha’s fingers trembled. She pressed the button to take the call on  \\nspeaker mode.\\n‘Hi everyone. Sorry to call so late,’ a cheerful voice came from the  \\nphone.\\n‘Err. Who is it?’ Esha said.\\n‘It’s God,’ the voice said.\\n‘God? God as in…’ Radhika said as all of us looked at the brightly-lit  \\nphone in fright.\\n‘As in God. I noticed an unusual situation here, so I thought I would just  \\ncheck on you guys.’\\n‘Who is this? Is this a joke/’ Vroom asked in a stronger voice.\\n‘Why? Am I being funny? I just said I am God,’ the voice said.\\nI narrowed my eyes. Apart from the fact that God using a cell phone was  \\nunusual, I never thought my life was important enough for God to call me.\\n‘God doesn’t normally call. Prove that you are God. Otherwise, can you  \\nplease get us some help,’ Vroom said.\\n‘How do I prove I am God? Do I make this cell phone float? Or do I create  \\nrain and lightning on demand? Or do you prefer magic tickets? Special effects  \\nmaybe?’ God said.\\n‘Well, I don’t know. But yeah, something like that,’ Vroom said.\\n‘So, to impress you I have to break the same laws of physics that I  \\nmade? I’m not into that these days. And I have plenty of believers. I thought I  \\ncould help, but I can hand up. See you then…’ God said.\\n‘No, no wait. Do help us…G…God,’ Esha said and turned slightly so she so  \\ncould hold the cell phone between all of us.\\nRadhika put a finger on her lips to signal Vroom to be quiet. ‘Okay, I’ll  \\nstay,’ God said in a cheerful voice. ‘Tell me, how is it going?’\\n‘Help us get out. A few more rods break and we are going to die,’ I said.\\n‘Not that, how is it going otherwise? How is life?’ God said.\\n I am really bad at tough, open-ended questions like that. I hate to  \\nadmit the extent to which my life is screwed up.\\n‘but right now we’re trapped…’ I said and God interrupted me.\\n‘Don’t worry. The Qualis isn’t going anywhere. Just relax.’\\nI let out a deep sigh. Everyone was silent.\\n‘So  back  to  the  question,  how  is  life  going?  You  want  to  go  first,  \\nRadhika?’ God said.\\n‘You are God.  Obviously you must already  know everything. Life is  \\nmiserable,’ Radhika said.\\n‘Actually, I  do know,’ God said. ‘I just want to find out how you feel  \\nabout it.’\\n‘I’ll tell you hoe we feel. Life suc…sorry,’ Vroom said, and checked  \\nhimself, ‘It’s awful. Like what did we do wrong? Why is our life in the pits—\\nliterally and figuratively? That pretty much sums it up for all of us I think.’Everyone made concurring sounds. God sighed.\\n‘Let me ask you a question. How many phone calls do you take every  \\nday?’ God said.\\n‘A hundred, on busy days two hundred,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Okay. Now do you know which is the most important call in the world?’\\n‘No,’ Vroom said. Everyone else shook their heads.\\n‘The inner call,’ God said.\\n‘The inner call?’ everyone said in unison.\\n‘Yes, the little voice inside that wants to take to you. But you can only  \\nhear it when you are at peace and then too it is hard to hard to hear it.  \\nBecause in modern life, the networks are too busy. The voice tells you what  \\nyou really want. Do you know what I am talking about?’\\n‘Sort of,’ Priyanka said, her eyes darting away from the phone.\\n‘That voice is mine, God said.\\n‘Really?’ Esha said, her mouth wide open.\\n‘Yes. And the voice is easy to ignore—because you are distracted or busy  \\nor just too comfortable in life. Go on, ignore it—until you get tangled in your  \\nown web of comfort. And then you reach a point like today, where life brings  \\nyou to a dead end, and there is nothing ahead but a dark hole.’\\n‘You’re making sense. I didn’t get it all, but you are making sense,’ I  \\nconceded, more to myself.\\n‘I know that voice. But it isn’t subtle in me. Sometimes it shouts and  \\nbites me,’ Vroom said.\\n‘And what does the voice say, Vroom?’ God said.\\n‘That I should not have taken up a job just for money. Call centers pay  \\nmore, but only because the exchange rate is in the favor of Americans. They  \\ntoss their loose change at us. It seems like a lot in rupees. But jobs that pay  \\nless could be better. There could be jobs that define me, make me learn of  \\nhelp my country. I justified it by saying money is progress. But it is not true.  \\nProgress is building something lasting for the future,’ Vroom said, something  \\nas if there was a lump in his throat. He pressed his face into his hands.\\nEsha put her hand on Vroom’s shoulder.\\n‘C’mon guys. This is getting way too sentimental. You can do a lot  \\nbetter than this. You are all capable people,’ God said.\\nIt was the first time someone was using the word ‘capable’ to describe  \\nme.\\n‘We can?’ I said.\\n‘Of course. Listen, I will make a deal with you. I will save your life  \\ntonight, but in return, you give me something. You close your eyes for three  \\nminutes. Think about what you really want and what you need to change in  \\nyour life to get it. Then, once you get out of here, act on those changes. You  \\ndo this, and I will help you get out of this pit. Deal?’\\n‘Deal,’ I said. Like you won’t do a deal that saves you from death.  \\nEveryone nodded.\\nWe closed our eyes and took a few deep breaths.Man, I tell you, closing your eyes for three minutes and not thinking  \\nabout the world is the hardest thing to do. I tried to concentrate, but all I  \\ncould see was commotion. Priyanka, Bakshi, my promotion and Ganesh—my  \\nmind kept jumping from one topic to another.\\n‘So, tell me,’ God said after three minutes.\\nWe opened our eyes. Everyone’s face was a lot calmer.\\n‘Ready?’ God said.\\nEveryone nodded their heads.\\n‘Let’s go around the Qualis one by one. Vroom, you first,’ God said.\\n‘I want to have a life with meaning, even if it means a life without Bed  \\nor daily trips to Pizza-Hut. I need to quit this call center. Sorry, but calling is  \\nnot my calling,’ Vroom said.\\nI thought his last line was quite clever, but it wasn’t the right time to  \\nappreciate verbal tricks.\\nPriyanka spoke after Vroom. My ears become extra alert.\\n‘I want my mother to be happy. But I cannot kill myself for it. My  \\nmother needs to realize a family is a great support to have, but ultimately,  \\nshe is responsible for her own happiness. My focus should be on my own life  \\nand what I want,’ Priyanka said. I wished she had said my name somewhere in  \\nher answer, but o such luck. I think ninety percent of Priyanka. And then he  \\nspoke the most I have heard him speak ever.\\n‘I want to be with my son and my grandson. I miss them every moment.  \\nTwo years ago, I used to live with them. But my daughter-in-law did things I  \\ndidn’t like—she went for parties, got a job when I wanted her to stay at  \\nhome…. If fought with them and moved out. But I was wrong. It Is their life,  \\nand I have no right to judge them by my outdated values. And I need to get rid  \\nof my inflated ego and go to the US to see them and talk it out.’\\nRadhika’s turn came next. She fought back her tears as she spoke. ‘I  \\nwant be myself again, just like I was before marriage, when I was with my  \\nparents. I want to divorce Anuj. I don’t want to ever look at my mother-in-\\nlaw’s face again. To do this, I have to accept that I made a wrong decision  \\nwhen I married Anuj.’\\nEsha spoke after Radhika. ‘I want my parents to love me again. I do not  \\nwant to become a dumb model. I am sure I can find a better use for my looks,  \\nif they are worth anything. Any career that makes you compromise on your  \\nmorals, or judges you because you are not an inch taller is not worth it.’\\nPeople now turned to look at me, as I was the only one left to speak.\\n‘Me? Can I pass?’ I said.\\nEveryone gave me an even harder state. Sometimes you have no choice  \\nbut to share you weird thoughts with the world.\\n‘Okay. This will sound stupid, but I want to take a shot at my own  \\nbusiness. I had this idea, if Vroom and I collaborate, we can set up a small  \\nweb design company. That is all. But it may never work, because most of the  \\nthings I do never work, but then…’\\n‘What else, Shyam/’ God said, interrupting me.\\n‘Uh, nothing,’ I said.‘Shyam, you are not done. You know that,’ God said.\\nI guess you can’t outsmart God. I just had to come to the point. I looked  \\naround and spoke again.\\n‘And I want to be worthy of someone like Priyanka one day, I do not  \\ndeserve her as of today, and I accept that…’\\n‘Shyam, I never said…’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Please, let me finish Priyanka. It is about time people stop trampling all  \\nover me,’ I said.\\nPriyanka looked at me and became silent. I could see she was in mild  \\nshock at my firmness.\\nI continued. ‘But one day I’d like to be worthy of someone like her—\\nsomeone intelligent, witty, sensitive and fun, someone who can seamlessly  \\nmerge friendship with love. And yes, one day I want to be successful too.’\\nWe had all finished our turns. God stayed silent.\\n‘God? Say something, now that we’ve poured out our deepest secrets to  \\nyou,’ Esha said.\\n‘I don’t really have to say anything. I am just amazed—and pleased—at  \\nhow well you have done. Knowing what you want is already a great start.  \\nReady to follow it through/’ God said.\\nEveryone nodded except me.\\n‘Ready, Shyam?’ God said.\\n I gave a small nod.\\n‘Shyam, can I say something personal before your friends,’ God said,  \\n‘because it is important for everyone as well.’\\n‘Sure,’ I said. Yeah, use me as Exhibit I for ‘how not to live your life’. At  \\nleast I am of some use.\\n‘You want to be successful right?’ God said.\\n‘Yes,’ I said.\\n‘There are four things a person needs for success. I will tell you the two  \\nobvious ones first. One, a medium amount of intelligence, and two, a bit of  \\nimagination. Agreed?’\\n‘Agreed,’ everyone said.\\n‘And all of you have those qualities,’ God said.\\n‘What’s that?’ I said.\\n‘Self-confidence.  The  third  thing  you  need  for  success  is  self-\\nconfidence. But Shyam has lost it. He is hundred percent convicted he is good  \\nfor nothing.’\\nI hung my head.\\n‘You know how you became convicted?’ God said.\\n‘How?’ I said.\\n‘Because of Bakshi. A bad boss is like a disease of the soul. If you have  \\none for long enough, you get convicted something is wrong with you. Even  \\nthough you know Bakshi is the real loser, you start doubting yourself. And  \\nthat is when your confidence goes.’\\nGod’s  words  shook  my  insides  like  the  vibrating  Qualis  had  a  few  \\nminutes ago.‘God, I want to get my confident back,’ I said.\\n‘Good. Don’t be scared and you will get it back. And then thee won’t be  \\nany stopping you,’ God said.\\nI felt the blood rush to my ears. My heart was beating hard and I wanted  \\nto be back at the call center. At the same time, anger surged in me as I  \\nthought of Bakshi. I wanted to get even with the man who had killed a part of  \\nme, who had put everyone’s job on the line, who had ruined the call center.\\n‘What’s the fourth ingredient for success?’ Vroom said.\\nThe fourth ingredient is the most painful one. And it is something all of  \\nyou still need to learn. Because it is often the most important thing,’ God  \\nsaid.\\n‘What/’ I said.\\n‘Failure,’ God said.\\n‘What? I thought you were talking about success,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Yes, but to be really successful, you must face failure. You have to  \\nexperience it, feel it, taste it, softer it. Only then can you shine,’ God said.\\n‘Why?’  Priyanka  said. Obviously  she  was  focused  on  my  personality  \\ndissection as well. I tell you, Ganesh may have the Lexus, but she will never  \\nfind as interesting a psycho case as me. \\n‘For once you taste failure, you have no fear. You can take risks more  \\neasily. Then you don’t want to snuggle in your comfort zone anymore—you  \\nare ready to fly. And success is about flying, not snuggling,’ God said.\\n‘Point, ‘ Priyanka said.\\n‘So, here is a secret. Never be afraid of failure. If it has come your way,  \\nit means I want to give you a real shot at being successful later,’ God said.\\n‘Cool,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Thank you,’ God said.\\n‘If only you had given India as much as America,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Why, you don’t like India/’ God said.\\n‘Of course not. Just because India is poor doesn’t mean you stop loving  \\nit. It is mine. But still, America has a lot,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Well, don’t be so high on America. Americans may have many things,  \\nbut they are not the happiest people on earth by any stretch. Any country  \\nobsessed with war can’t be happy,’ God said.\\n‘True,’ Radhika said.\\n‘And many of them have serious issues in the head. Issues only call  \\ncenter agents know about. And you can use them to save your call center  \\ntonight,’ God said.\\n‘The messed up heads of Americans will save our call center? Vroom,  \\nRadhika and I spoke together.\\n‘Yes. Think about their weak spots, and then you can win,’ God said.\\n‘Like what/ they are fat, loud, thick and divorce all the time?’ Esha said.\\n‘There are more. I will give you a hint. What’s behind all this war  \\nsentiment?’ God said.\\n‘Fear. It is obvious, they are the most scared and paranoid people on  \\nearth,’ I said.‘We’ll scare them into calling us. Yes, that will get us back our call  \\nvolumes,’ Vroom said, his voice excited.\\n‘Now you are thinking. In fact, you can figure out a way to get even with  \\nBakshi too. Not completely fair and square, but by now you deserve to bend a  \\nfew rules in the game,’ God said, and I though I heard a chuckle.\\nEveryone smiled.\\n‘Really, we can teach Bakshi a lesson/’ I said.\\n‘sure, remember Bakshi is not your boss, the ultimate boss is me. And I  \\nam with you. So what you afraid of?’ God said.\\n‘Excuse me, but you are not there with us always. Or how did we end  \\nup here?’ Radhika said.\\nGod sighed before speaking again. ‘I think you need to understand how  \\nmy system works. You see, I have a contract with all human beings. You do  \\nyour best, and every now and then, I will come behind to give you a bonus  \\npush. But is has to begin with you. For otherwise I can’t distinguish who needs  \\nmy help most.’\\n‘Point,’ Vroom said.\\n‘So, if I listen to my inner call and promise to do my best, will you be  \\nthere for me?’ I said.\\n‘Absolutely. But, I have to go now. Someone else needs no reach me,’  \\nGod said.\\n‘Wait! Hel us get us out of this pit first,’ Esha said.\\n‘Oh yes, of course. I have to help you out of this pit,’ God said. ‘Okay,  \\nVroom, you are balancing on a few rods now. There are two tricks to get out  \\nfrom such a situation.’\\n‘What’s that/’\\n‘One, remember the reverse gear. And two, make friends with the rods\\n—do not fight them. Use the rod as rail tracks and the rods will guise you out.  \\nShake things around, and you will fall right through.’\\nVroom stuck his neck out of the window. ‘But these steel construction  \\nrods are as thin s my fingers. How do we bunch them up?’\\n‘Tie then,’ God said.\\n‘How?’ Vroom said.\\n‘Do I need to tell you everything?’ God said.\\n‘Dupatta. Use my dupatta,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Here, I have this half kn9itted scarf in my handbag too,’ Radhika said.\\n‘I think you can take from here. Bye now. Remember, I am inside you  \\nwhen you need me,’ God said.\\n‘Huh?’ Vroom said and looked at the phone.\\n‘Bye God,’ the girls said one after the other.\\n‘Bye everyone,’ God said and disconnected the call. I waved the phone  \\ngoodbye in reflex. Silence fell on us.\\n‘What. Was. That?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘I don’t know. Can I have the dupattas please,’ Vroom said. ‘Military  \\nUncle, can you open the rear door and tie up the rods under the wheel. Tear  \\nup the dupatta if you want to.’Priyanka flinched for a second at the last line, but that was the last we  \\nsaw of her dupatta and Radhika’s half-scarf. Vroom and Military Uncle tied up  \\nthe rods right under the wheel for the Qualis to do its ten-foot journey to  \\nreach firm ground. Several times they bent over deep and had to look right  \\ninto the pit. I was glad I was not the one doing it—I would have died just from  \\nthe view.\\n‘Okay people,’ Vroom sat back on the seat, wiping his hands, ‘hold  \\ntight.’\\nVroom started the ignition. The Qualis vibrated, as the rods below us  \\nstarted quivering again.\\n‘Vrr...oom…I am…sl…ipp..ing,’ Esha said, trying to grip the handle of the  \\nglove box.\\nIn a nanosecond, Vroom put the Qualis in reverse and drove back. All of  \\nus ducked down, partially so Vroom could see, but mostly in feat.\\nThe Qualis shook as if It was rumbling down a hill. However, we did not  \\nfall. My upper and lower jaws chattered so hard that I thought a couple of  \\nteeth would break loose.\\nIn six second, it was all over. We were out of the pit and on the slushy  \\nmud road again.\\n‘It’s done. I think I am alive,’ Vroom said with a grin of relief. He turned  \\naround. ‘Did anyone survive?’#31\\nEveryone released their breaths together. The girls broke into hugs, and  \\nVroom reached out and backslapped me so hard I thought I would die of a  \\nbroken spinal cord.\\nVroom  took  a  U-turn  and  drove  back  slowly  in  first  gear  until  we  \\nreached the highway.\\n‘We made it,’ Esha said and wiped her tears. Priyanka folded her hands  \\nand prayed a few times.\\n‘I thought we would die,’ Radhika said.\\n‘What was that call?’ Esha said.\\n‘Something very strange—van we make a pact to not talk about it?’ I  \\nsaid. Everyone nodded, as if I had said exactly what was on their mind. It was  \\ntrue. The call felt so personal, I did not want to discus it anymore.\\n‘Whatever it was, we are okay now. And we shall be in office soon,’  \\nPriyanka said.\\n‘It’s still only 4:40. We are just two kilometers away,’ Vroom said. He  \\nsoon regained his confidence and began driving at sixty an hour.\\n‘I’m just lucky to be alive, I don’t care when we reach,’ Esha said.\\n‘I do want to reach soon and find out about the layoffs. However, I’m  \\nquitting in any case,’ Vroom said.\\n‘Yes, enough’s enough,’ Vroom said.\\n‘I  don’t  know  long-term—maybe  get  back  to  journalism.  But  as  an  \\nimmediate short-term goal, I’m going to try and save the call center,’ Vroom  \\nsaid.\\n‘With you?’ Vroom said, looking back at me.\\n‘I’m quitting too,’ I said.\\n‘Really?’ Priyanka’s eyes popped open. She looked at me as if a seven-\\nyear-old had just announced his decision to climb Mt. Everest. \\n‘Yes, I came close to death in that pit. I could have died there, with  \\nhaving tried nothing in life. I am tired of soft, comfortable options. It is time  \\nto face the real world, even if it is harder and painful. I’d rather fly and  \\ncrash, than just snuggle and sleep.’\\nEveryone nodded. I was shocked; people were really listening to me for  \\nthe first time.\\n‘Plus, I have made one more promise to myself,’ I said.\\n‘What?’ Vroom and Priyanka said together.\\n‘That I am not going to work for an idiot anymore, anywhere. Even if it  \\nmeans less money. I cold skip a meal a day and sleep hungry, but, hell, I can’t  \\nspend my life working for a moron.’\\n‘Not  bad,’  Vroom  said,  ‘looks  like  our  team  leader-in-waiting  just  \\nbecame wiser.’\\n‘I don’t know if it is wise or note, but at least I have made a choice. We  \\nwill see what happens. For now, I have a short-term goal too.’‘Like what,’ Vroom said, as he drove with utmost concentration, ‘don’t  \\ntell me it is call documentation and all.’ \\n‘No. I have to take care of Bakshi too. Since we have nothing to lose,  \\nlet’s teach him a lesson,’ I said.\\nVroom screeched the Qualis to a halt and we all fell forward.\\n‘Now what?’ I said.\\n‘Wait. I just had an Eureka moment. I have an idea for fixing Bakshi and  \\nthe call center,’ Vroom said.\\n‘What?’\\n‘Aha, I like it,’ Vroom said and smiled to himself.\\n‘What, damn it,’ I said.\\nHe leaned back and whispered something in my ear.\\n‘No way, I mean how/’ I said.\\n‘Yes way, I mean how?’ I said.\\n‘Yes way, I’ll tell you how when we get back. Let’s meet in the WASG  \\nconference room,’ he said and pressed the accelerator hard as we made the  \\nfinal stretch to reach the call center. We entered the Connexions main gate at  \\n4:45 a.m. We passed Bakshi’s car again.\\n‘Want to bump it. Should we give it a nasty dent?’ I said to Vroom.\\n‘The thought crossed my mind,’ Vroom said and let out a sigh, ‘but I  \\nlove all automobiles too much to hurt them. This Lancer is already suffering  \\nunder Bakshi. Don’t worry, we will deal with him inside.\\nVroom took the Qualis to the parking lot. Our driver was sleeping in  \\nanother vehicle, so we quietly parked the Qualis next to him. We wanted to  \\ngive him a few more hours of rest before he saw his mud-coated vehicle.\\n‘People, let’s go, 4:46,’ Vroom said and jumped out of the car.\\nAt our desk, I saw an A4-sized sheet stuck on my monitor with big bold  \\nletters scrawled on it.\\n‘Check this out,’ I said . It was Bakshi’s writing.\\nWHERE IS EVERYONE? PLEASE CALL/REPORT TO MY OFFICE  \\nASAP. WHERE ARE MY BOARD MEETING AGENDA COPIES?  \\nWHAT  HAPPENED  TO  THE  XEROX  MACHINE?  AGENT  \\nVICTOR’S MONITOR?\\nVroom  looked  at  the  notice  and  laughed.  ‘Whatever.  He’ll  get  hi  \\nanswers. But first, he will answer us. Guys, conference room first,’ vroom  \\nsaid.\\nWe went inside the conference room and Vroom bolted the door.\\n‘Guys, sorry to sound like the MBA types, but I think in the next few  \\nhours we have a three-point agenda. One, to save this call center. And two, to  \\nteach Bakshi a lesson. Agreed?’ \\n‘What’s the third point?’ Radhika said.\\n‘That’s between me and Shyam. It’s private. Okay, listen…’\\nAnd that is where Vroom revealed his plan to a) save the call center and  \\nb) take care of Bakshi. All of us jumped in our seats when we first heard it.  Slowly, Vroom convinced us. Between laughter and intense concentration,  \\neveryone pooled in to refine the plan further. We concluded our meeting at  \\n5:100 a.m. and came out of the WASG conference room.\\n‘All set?’ Vroom said.\\n‘Of course,’ all of us said in unison.\\n‘Good. Step 1: Getting Bakshi out of his office,’ Vroom said. ‘Esha, you  \\nready?’\\n‘Yes,’ Esha said and winked at us.\\nShe picked up the phone, dialed Bakshi’s number and took on the voice  \\nof an older woman.\\n‘Sir, this is Elina calling from the main bay. Sir, there is a call for you  \\nfrom Boston I think,’ Esha said. In a dumb-but-conscientious secretarial tone.\\n‘No sir, I can’t seem to transfer it… Sir, I tried that, but the line does  \\nnot go through… Sir, I am a new assistant here, so I still do not know how the  \\nphones work… Sir, sorry but can you come down sir… Yes sir,’ Esha said and  \\nhung up the phone.\\n‘Worked?’ I said.\\n‘Total sucker for anything Boston. He is coming right now. But he’ll only  \\nbe out for a few minutes, so let’s rush.’#32\\nAs expected, Bakshi’s office was empty when we got there. Vroom went  \\nstraight to Bakshi’s computer and opened his email.\\nRadhika, Priyanka and I sat as Bakshi’s conference table.\\n‘Hurry,’ Radhika said and kept one eye on the door.\\n‘Just one more minute,’ Vroom said as he furiously typed on Bakshi’s  \\nkeyboard.\\nI know what we were doing was wrong, but somehow doing this wrong  \\nthing was not associated with ‘real, hard, painful guilt,’ as Esha had put it. In  \\nfact, it felt good. Once he had finished, Vroom printed several copies on  \\nBakshi’s printer.\\n‘Five copies,’ he said, ‘one for each of us. Fold it and keep is safe.’\\nI folded my copy and put in my shirt pocket.\\nBakshi arrived twenty seconds later.\\n‘Can’t believe we have such outdated telephone systems,’ Bakshi was  \\ntalking to himself as he came into his office. He noticed us at the conference  \\ntable.\\n‘There you guys are. Where were all of you? And what happened to the  \\nXerox machine and agent Victor’s monitor?’ Bakshi said. He wrapped his arms  \\naround like middle and looked at each of us in quick succession.\\n‘Sit down for a second, will you Bakshi?’ Vroom said, patting a chair  \\nnext to him.\\n‘What/’ Bakshi said, shocked at Vroom referring to him by his name. You  \\nshould learn how to address seniors…’\\n‘Whatever Bakshi,’ Vroom said and put his feet up on Bakshi’s meeting  \\ntable.\\n‘Agent Victor, what did you say and what exactly do you think you are  \\ndoing/’ Bakshi said, still standing.\\n‘Ahh’ Vroom said, ‘this is so much more comfortable. Why don’t people  \\nalways sit like this?’ Vroom crossed his legs on the table.\\n‘I can’t believe you are misbehaving in times when I have to recommend  \\nrightsizing…’ Bakshi said as Vroom interrupted him again.\\n‘You are mega fucked Bakshi..’ Vroom interrupted him.\\n‘Excuse me/ what did you just say Agent Victor?’\\n‘So you are not only dumb, but deaf too. Didn’t you hear him?’ Esha  \\nsaid, trying hard to suppress a smile.\\n‘What the hell is going on here?’ Bakshi said and looked at me blankly  \\nlike I was a renowned interpreter of nonsense. \\nVroom pushed a printout towards Bakshi.\\n‘What’s this?’ Bakshi said.\\n‘Read it. They taught you how to read in the MBA course, right?’ Vroom  \\nsaid.\\nThe email read as follows:From: Subhash Bakshi \\nTo: Esha Singh\\nSent: 5.04 am\\nSubject: Just one night\\nDear Esha,\\nDon’t be upset. My offer is simple-just spend one night with  \\nme. You make ma happy –I’ll save your you from the right-\\nsizing. My pleasure for you security–I think it is a fair deal.  \\nAnd who knows, you might enjoy it too. Let me know your  \\ndecision soon.\\nYour admirer.\\nBakshi.\\nBakshi’s face turned white. His mouth opened five inches wide as he re-\\nread the email several times.\\n‘What is this? What the hell is this?’ Bakshi said, his hands trembling as  \\nmuch as his voice. His mouth was still open and vibrated like it was battery  \\noperated.\\n‘You tell us. It is a mail from your inbox, dumb ass,’ Vroom said.\\nBut I never wrote it,’ Bakshi said, unable to hide a hint of desperation in  \\nvoice, ‘I never wrote it.’\\n‘Really?’ Vroom said as he lit a cigarette. ‘Now how can you prove you  \\ndidn’t write it? Can you prove it to people in the Boston office that you didn’t  \\nwrite it?’\\n‘What are you talking about? How is the connected to Boston?’ Bakshi  \\nsaid, his face sprouting droplets of sweat through the oilfields.\\n‘Let’s see.  What is we forward Boston a copy of this mail? The same  \\npeople who you copied on the website manual? I am sure they love employees  \\nwho do, well, fair deals,’ I said.\\n‘I never wrote it,’ Bakshi said, unable to think of better lines.\\n‘Or we could send a copy to the police,’ Vroom said as he blew a huge  \\npuff of smoke on Bakshi’s face, ‘and to some of my reporter friends. You want  \\nto be in the papers tomorrow Bakshi? Here is your chance,’ Vroom took out  \\nhis phone, ‘Oh wait, maybe I can even get you on TV.’\\n‘TV?’ Bakshi said.\\n‘Yes, imagine the headline: ‘Call center boss asks girls for sexual favors  \\nin exchange for job’. NDTV could live on that for a week. Damn, I know I could  \\nbe a good journalist,’ Vroom said and laughed.\\n‘But what did it do?’ Bakshi said and ran to his desk. He opened his  \\nemail and checked the ‘Sent Items’ folder.\\n‘Who wrote this?’ Bakshi said and ran to his desk. He opened his email  \\nand check the ‘Sent Items” folder.\\n‘Who wrote this?’ Bakshi said as he saw the same mail on his screen.\\n‘You didn’t?’ Priyanka said, as if in genuine confusion.‘Mr Bakshi, I held you in such high esteem. Today my faith in my role-\\nmodel is shattered,’ Esha sand and put her hands to her face. She was good—I  \\nthink she should try for an acting career.\\n‘No, I swear I did not,’ Bakshi said, as he scrambled with his mouse and  \\nkeyboard.\\n‘Then who wrote it? Santa Claus? The tooth fairy?’ Vroom shouted and  \\nstood up. ‘You explain this to the police, the journalists and over the video  \\nconference to Boston exces.’\\n‘hah! Look  I have deleted  it,’ Bakshi  said  with a  smug smile is he  \\nreleased his computer mouse.\\n‘C’mon Bakshi,’ Vroom said with a sigh, ‘it’s still in your ‘Deleted Items  \\nfolder.’\\n‘Oh,’ Bakshi said and jerked his mouse. A few clicks later he said,  \\n‘There, it is gone. No more email.’\\nVroom smiled, ‘One more tip for you Bakshi. Go to your Deleted Items,  \\nselected the tools menu and choose the “recover deleted items” option. The  \\nmail will be there,’ Vroom said.\\nBakshi’s  face  panicked  again  as  tried  to  follow  Vroom’s  complex  \\ninstructions. He desperately clicked his mouse.\\n‘Oh, stop it Bakshi. The mail is in my inbox as well. And Vroom has many  \\nprintouts,’ Esha said.\\n‘Huh?’ Bakshi said as he looked like a scared rabbit. ‘You’ll never get  \\naway with this. Esha you know I didn’t do it. You wear right skirts and tops  \\nbut I only look at them from a distance. Even those jeans that show your waist  \\nI only saw…’\\n‘Stop right there, you sicko,’ Esha said.\\n‘You can’t get away with this,’ Bakshi said.\\n‘We have five witnesses Bakshi, they will support Esha’s testimony,’ I  \\nsaid.\\n‘Oh, an we have some other evidence as well. In Esha’s drawer there is  \\na packet with cash, it has your fingerprints on I, in case you want to get tot  \\nhat level,’ Vroom said.\\nBakshi’s fingers trembled as if he was getting ready to ply drums.\\n‘We  also  have  a  printout  of  your  visits  to  pornographic  websites,’  \\nRadhika said.\\n‘You know it is not me Esha, I will finally get proved innocent,’ Bakshi  \\nsaid, his voice sounding like a hapless beggar’s. His eyes looked ready to leak.\\n‘Maybe. But the amazing publicity will be enough to screw your career.  \\nGoodbye Boston,’ I said and waved my hand to indicate farewell. Everyone  \\nelse raided their hand and waved goodbye as well.\\nBakshi looked at us in horror and sat down. His white face had now  \\nturned red, or rather purple—even though it was still as shiny as ever. I could  \\nsee a twitching nerve on the side of his forehead. I felt an urge to make him  \\nsuffer more. I stood up to pick a thick management book from his bookshelf.\\nI went up to Bakshi and stood next to him.‘Why are you doing this to me? I will be leaving you forever to go to  \\nBoston,’ Bakshi said.\\n‘Boston?’ I said. ‘You do not deserve a posting to Bhatinda. You do not  \\neven deserve a job. In fact, one could argue you do not even deserve to live.  \\nYou are not just a bad boss, you are a parasite: to us, to this company, to this  \\ncountry. Damn you.’\\nI banged the management book on his hard head. God, it felt head was  \\nhollow, as the impact made a big noise. God, it felt good. Few people in this  \\nworld get to hit their boss, but those who do will tell you it is better than sex.\\n‘What do you want? What is it you want? You wan to destroy me,’ Bakshi  \\nsaid, rubbing his head. ‘I have a family with two kids. With great difficulty my  \\ncareer is going fine. My wife wants to leave me anyway. Don’t destroy me. I  \\nam human too.’\\nI disagreed with Bakshi’s last phrase. I didn’t think he was human at all.\\n‘Destroying you is a good, fun option,’ Vroom said, ‘but we have more  \\nworthwhile goals for now. I want to do a deal with you. We bury this issue and  \\nin return you do some things for us.’\\n‘What kind of things?’ Bakshi said.\\n‘One. I want to have control of the call center for the next two hours. I  \\nneed to get on the mass speaker.’\\nThe one management is used to talk to everyone. Why do you want it?  \\nWill you talk about this email?’ Bakshi said.\\n‘No, you moron. It is so save jobs at the call center. Now, do I have the  \\nspeaker?’\\n‘Yes. What else?’\\n‘I want you to write out a resignation letter for Shyam and me. Layoffs  \\nor not, we are quitting Connexions.’\\n‘You guys are quitting right now?’ the girls said.\\n‘Yes. Shyam and I will start a small website design business. Right,  \\nShyam?’ Vroom said.\\n‘Yes,’ I said. Wow! I thought.\\n‘Good. And this time, no idiot will take credit for our websites,’ Vroom  \\nsaid and slapped Bakshi’s face. Bakshi’s face turned sixty degrees from the  \\nimpact. He held his cheeks but remained silent, apart from a tiny dry sob. His  \\nfacial expression had a combination of ninety percent pain and ten percent  \\nshame\\n‘May I?’ I said.\\n‘Be my guest,’ Vroom said.\\nSlap! I gave a slap on Bakshi’s face. The face turned sixty degrees in the  \\nother direction. It was my most fun career moment. The shiny face turned  \\nhot.\\n‘So you will do the resignation letter, okay?’ Vroom said.\\n‘Okay,’ Bakshi said, rubbing his cheek. ‘But Esha will delete the email  \\nright?’‘Wait. We  are  not done. Our  business will  require start-up capital.  \\nTherefore, we need a severance package of six months’ salary. Understood?’  \\nVroom said.\\n‘I cannot do six months. It is unprecedented for agents,’ Bakshi said.\\n‘NDTV or Times of India, you pick,’ Vroom said as he took out his phone.\\n‘Six months is possible. Good managers break precedents,’ Bakshi said. I  \\nguess no number of slaps could break his jargon.\\n‘Nice. Last thing. I want you to retract the right-sizing proposal. Arrange  \\na call with Boston. Ask them to postpone the layoffs to try a new sales-driven  \\nrecovery plan for Connexions.\\n‘I can’t do that,’ Bakshi said.\\nVroom lifted his mobile phone and put it in front of Bakshi’s face.\\n‘I’ll make sure all of India knows you by tomorrow,’ Vroom said. ‘Listen,  \\nyou idiot. I don’t care about this job, but there are agents with kids, families  \\nand responsibilities in life. You can’t just fire them. They are people, not  \\nresources. Now, which news channel is your favorite?’\\n‘Give me half an hour. I’ll set up a call with Boston,’ Bakshi said.\\n‘Good we’ll bury the email. But you get the hell out of the call center,  \\nthis city, and this country as fast as you can. We need a new boss. We need a  \\nnormal, decent, inspiring human being and not a slimy, blood-sucking goofball  \\nwith fancy degrees.’\\nBakshi nodded as he continuously wiped the sweat from his face.\\n‘Good. Anything else?; you had  some questions about my monitor?’  \\nVroom said.\\n‘Monitor? What monitor?’ Bakshi said.#33\\nBakshi gave Vroom the key to the speaker room. Soon, Bakshi was on his  \\nphone, calling Boston to arrange management meetings. I have never seen  \\nhim work so efficiently.\\nVroom went to the broadcast room and switched on the mikes. I went to  \\nthe main computers bay to check for sound quality.\\n‘Hello, everyone. May I have your attention please? This is Vroom, from  \\nthe strategic group.’\\nVroom’s voice echoed through Connexions. Every agent looked up at the  \\nspeakers as they continued to talk tot heir customers.\\n‘Sorry, to bother you, but we have an emergency. This is about the  \\nlayoffs. Can you please disconnect all your calls,’ the speaker said.\\nEveryone heard the word layoffs and a thousand calls ended at the same  \\ntime. New calls flashed, but no one picked them up. Vroom continued:\\n‘Idiots have managed this place, because of which we have to suffer  \\ntonight. For their mistakes, more than a third of you will lose your jobs. It  \\ndoes not seem fair to me. Does it seem fair to you?’\\nNo response came back.\\n‘C’mon guys, I want to hear you. Do I have your support to save your  \\njobs band this call center?’\\nAll the agents looked at each other, still in partial disbelief. Many of  \\nthem said a weak ‘yes’.\\n‘Louder guys, all together. Do I have your support?’ Vroom said.\\n‘Yes!’ a collective scream rocked Connexions.\\nI was standing at the corner hall of the main bay. Every agent glued his  \\nor her eyes to the fire-drill speaker. Vroom continued, this time in a firmer  \\nvoice.\\n‘Thank you. My friends, I am angry. Because every day, I see some of  \\nthe  world’s  strongest  and  smartest  people  in  my  country.  I  see  all  this  \\npotential, yet it is all  getting wasted. An entire generation up all  night,  \\nproviding crutches for the white morons to run their lives. And then big  \\ncompanies come and convince us with their advertising to vale crap we don’t  \\nneed, do jobs we hate so that we can but stuff—junk food, colored fizzy  \\nwater, dumbass credit cards and overpriced shoes. They call it youth culture.  \\nIs this what they think youth is about? Two generations ago, the youth got this  \\ncountry free. Now that was something meaningful. But what happened after  \\nthat? We have just been reduced to a high-spending demographic. The only  \\nyouth power they care about is our spending power,’ Vroom said, and even I  \\nwas amazed at the attention every agent gave him.\\nVroom continued: ‘Meanwhile bad bosses and stupid Americans suck the  \\nlife blood out of our country’s most productive generation. But tonight we will  \\nshow them. And for that I need your support. Tell me are you ready to work  \\nhard for the next two hours?’‘Yes!’ a collective vice cam back. The whole call center vibrated as  \\nVroom paused to take a breath.\\n‘Good, then listen. The call center will survive if our call traffic goes up.  \\nMy plan is to scare the Americans into calling us regularly. Tell them that  \\nterrorists have hit America with a new computer virus that will take their  \\ncountry down. The only was they can be safe is if they keep calling us to  \\nreport there status. We do it like this, pull out every customer number you  \\nhave and call them. I will send you a call script on email. The mail will come  \\nto you in five minutes. Until then, get those numbers out,’ Vroom said.\\nNoise levels rose in the main bay as hundreds of localized conversation  \\ntook place simultaneously. There was a frenzy as people took printouts of all  \\ncustomer numbers in their database. Nobody was sure if the plan would work,  \\nbut people were willing to try anything to avoid layoffs.\\nVroom and I came to our bay. He typed furiously on his computer and  \\ntapped my shoulder after a few minutes.\\n‘Check your email,’ Vroom said and pointed to my screen.\\nI opened my inbox. Vroom had sent the mail to everyone in the call  \\ncenter.\\nSubject: Operation Yankee Fear\\nDear All.\\nOperating  Yankee  Fear’s  single  aim  is  to  increase  the  \\nincoming call traffic \\nIn the Connexions call center, capitalizing on Americans being the biggest  \\ncowards on the planet. This will prevent the planned mass-layoffs and help  \\nus buy more time to fix things around the place, including a marketing  \\nefforts to get new clients.\\nOperation Yankee Fear cannot succeed without your 100% cooperation. So,  \\nplease  read  the  instructions  below  carefully  and  relentlessly  focus  on  \\nmaking calls for the next two hours. When you call each customer, the key  \\nmessage you have to deliver is as follows:\\n1.Start by saying you are sorry to disturb them on Thanksgiving Day.\\n2.State that ‘evil forces’ of the world have unleashed a computer virus  \\nthat threatens to pervade every computer in America. This way the evil  \\nforces will monitor every American and eventually destroy the American  \\neconomy. Tel them that, according to your information, the virus has  \\nhit their computer.\\n3.If asked what the ‘evil forces’ are, give vague explanation like ‘forces  \\nthat want to harm the US’ or ‘organizations that threaten freedom and  \\nliberty’  etc.  Remember,  the  more  vague  you  are,  the  greater  the  \\namount of fear you can create. Try to inject genuine panic into your  \\nvoice.\\n4.To check whether the virus has hit them or not, make them do an  \\nMSWord test. Tell them to open an empty MSWord file, and type in  =rand (200, 99) and press enter. If a lot of text pops comes out, that  \\nmeans there is a virus. (Don’t worry: the text will pop out-it is a bug in  \\nMSWord). Once that happens, your customers might start shaking in  \\nfear.\\n5.Tell them you can save them from this virus as a) you are from India,  \\nand all Indians are good at computers b) India has faced terrorism for  \\nyears  and  c)  they  are  valued  clients  and  you  believe  in  customer  \\nservice.\\n6.However, if they want our help, they must keep calling the Connexions  \\ncall center every six hours. Even if nothing happens, they should just  \\ncall to say things are okay. (The shorter the calls, the better for us  \\nanyway).\\n7.Once calls rise, I will speak to Boston about the sudden rise in traffic  \\nand recommend we postpone the layoffs for two months.\\nAfter that, we can implement a revival strategy.\\nCheers,\\nVarun @ WASG\\nVroom grinned and winked at me as I finished reading the email.\\n‘What’s with the MSWord trick?’ I said.\\nI opened an empty Word document and typed in =rand (200,99).\\nAs soon as I pressed Enter, two hundred pages of text popped out. It was  \\nspooky, and went something like this:\\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps  \\nover the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick  \\nbrown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy  \\ndog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox  \\njumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The  \\nquick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over  \\nthe lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown  \\nfox jumps …………\\n‘This is unbelievable. What is this?’ I said.\\n‘I told you. It’s bug in MSWord. Nothing is perfect. Now just wait and  \\nwatch the fun,’ Vroom said.\\nVroom’s  email  reached  a  thousand  mailboxes  and  agents  read  it  \\nimmediately.\\nTeam  leader  further  assisted  agents  in  clarifying  doubts.  With  in  \\nminutes, agents were doing a job they knew only too well: calling people to  \\ndeliver a message as fast as possible. I left my bay and passed by the main  \\nbay. I picked up random sentences from the telephone conversations.‘Hello  Mr William, sorry  to disturb you on  Thanksgiving.  I  am from  \\nWestern Computers with an urgent situation. America is under a virus attack,’  \\none agent said.\\n‘Yes sir, your computer as per our records is affected…’ said another.\\n‘Don’t freak out sir. But, yes, it looks like the evil forces have targeted  \\nyou,’ an eighteen-year-old agent said. ‘But we can save you.’\\n‘Just keep calling us. Every four to six hours,’ said one, as she ended  \\nthe call.\\nThe more aggressive agents went a step further: ‘And I want you to tell  \\nall your friends and relatives. Yes, they can call us too.’\\nSome  customers  panicked,  and  agents  had  to  reassure  them:  ‘No  \\nproblem. We will save this country. The evil forces will never succeed.’\\nA thousand agents, four minutes to a call—we could do thirty thousand  \\ncalls in two hours. If they called us every six hours, we would have over a  \\nhundred thousand calls a day. Even if this lasted a week, we would hit our  \\ntargets to cover the next two months. Hopefully, with a new manager and  \\nextra sales effort, Connexions could recover. And for now, no one would lose  \\nhis or her job.\\nVroom cam looking for me in the main bay. We went back to the WASG.  \\nVroom signaled me into the conference room.\\n‘The response is amazing. We have just called for thirty minutes, and  \\ncall traffic is up five times already.’ Vroom said.\\n‘Rocking  man,’ I said. ‘You make me feel confident about our web  \\ndesign company. But let’s go back to the desk, why have you called me here?’\\n‘We have to discuss the third private agenda.’\\n‘What’s that?’ I said.\\n‘The third agenda is for you. Don’t you want Priyanka back?’#3  4  \\n‘No. Priyanka and I are over,’ I said.\\n‘Be honest dude. You spoke to God and everything.’\\nI looked down. Vroom waited until I said something.\\n‘It doesn’t matter if I want to or not. Look at my competition. How am I  \\ngoing to succeed against Mr Perfect Match Ganesh?’\\n‘See, that is the problem. We all think Ganesh is Mr Perfect. But nobody  \\nis perfect.’\\n‘Yeah right. A  house with a pool, a car that costs more than ten years’  \\nof my salary, freaking working for the world’s top company—I don’t see much  \\nimperfection in that.’\\n‘Everyone has a flaw, dude. The trick is to find a flaw in Ganesh.’\\n‘Well how are we ever going to do that? And even if we find a flaw in  \\nhim, what is the point? He is so good, Priyanka will still go for him,’ I said.\\n‘At least Priyanka will know she isn’t making the perfect trade-off,’  \\nVroom said.\\nI remained silent for two minutes. ‘Yes, but how do we find Ganesh’s  \\nflaw now?’ I said and looked at my watch. It was 5:30 a.m.\\n‘There must be a way,’ Vroom said.\\n‘The shift is over in ninety minutes, and then Priyanka goes home. What  \\nare you planning to do? Hire some instant detectives in Seattle?’ I said, my  \\nvoice irritated.\\n‘Don’t give up Shyam,’ Vroom said and patted my shoulder.\\n‘I am trying to forget Priyanka. But if you search within me, there is still  \\npain. Don’t make it worse, Vroom.’\\n‘Wow, what drama. Search within me, there is pain, Vroom said and  \\nlaughed.\\n‘Sorry for my lame lines. Let’s go back to the bay,’ I said.\\n‘Hey wait a minute. You just said search.’\\n‘Yes, search within me, there is still pain. Pretty cheesy, I know. Why?’  \\nI said.\\n‘Search. That is what we can do. Google will be our detective. Let’s do a  \\nsearch on his name and see what comes out. There could be some surprises.’\\n‘What? You want to do a search for Ganesh?’\\n‘Yes, but we need his full name. Let’s find out his college at well. I  \\nthink he did his masters in computers from the US,’ he said and grabbed my  \\nshirt. ‘C’mon, let’s go.’\\n‘Where?’ I said, even as I let myself get dragged.\\n‘To the WASG bay,’ Vroom said.\\nPriyanka was busy on the phone, scaring Americans out of their wits. I  \\nthink  she  can  put  on  that  voice  of  authority  when  she  wants,  and  it  is  \\nimpossible not to believe her. It comes from her mother I think. Vroom spoke  \\nto her after she had ended a call.‘Hey  Priyanka,  quick  question.  My  cousin  also  did  a  Masters  in  \\ncomputers from the US. Which college did Ganesh go to?’\\n‘Huh? Wisconsin I think,’ she said.\\n‘Really. Let me email my cousin and ask him if it is the same one. What  \\nis Ganesh’s full name by the way?’\\n‘Gupta. Ganesh Gupta,’ Priyanka said as she prepared to make another  \\ncall.\\n‘Oooh Mrs Priyanka Gupta,’ Esha said in a mock high-society voice and  \\nlaughed. Priyanka pocked her with her elbow. Priyanka’s new name sent  \\nripples of pain down my rib cage.\\n‘Cool. Keep calling,’ Vroom said and went back to his seat.\\nAs Vroom’s monitor was broken, he took control of my computer. He  \\nsearched for the following terms on google.com:\\nganesh gupta drunk Wisconsin\\nganesh gupta fines Wisconsin\\nganesh gupta girlfriend\\nSeveral links popped out, but there was nothing we could make much  \\nsense or use of. We hit upon Ganesh’s list of classmates, and found out that  \\nhe was in the Dean’s list in Boston.\\n‘Damn, what a boring guy. Let me try some more,’ Vroom said and did  \\nsome more searches.\\nganesh gupta fail\\nganesh gupta party\\nNothing interesting came out.\\n‘Forget it man. He was probably the head boy in school,’ I said.\\n‘You bet, one of those teacher’s per types,’ Vroom said, letting out a  \\nfrustrated breath. ‘I give up. I am sure if I type something like this. Lots will  \\npop out, achiever that he is.’\\nganesh gupta Microsoft award\\nMore links popped out. We clicked through a few, and then we hit on  \\none with his picture. It was Ganesh’s online album.\\n‘Damn, it is him, with his buddies,’ Vroom whispered and clicked on the  \\nlink. ‘Let’s check out how ugly his friends are.’\\nThe link opened to a webpage titled ‘Microsoft Award Party photos.’  \\nThe party was at Ganesh’s house. Ganesh had won some sidey developer  \\naward  at  Microsoft.  A  couple  of  his  friends  had  come  to  his  house  to  \\ncelebrate.\\n‘Do slideshow,’ I said as Vroom selected the option. We looked up once  \\nto confirm the girls were busy with their calls.\\nAs the picture came on the screen, we saw a garden party full of Indian  \\npeople. On the tables, there was enough food to feed a small town. I saw  \\nGanesh’s house and the over-hyped personal pool. It was no more than an  oversized bathtub, if you ask me, even though Ganesh had made it sound like  \\nOlympic champions trained in it.\\n‘Hey, I think we found something. Check out our man,’ Vroom said. He  \\npointed to one of the photos in which Ganesh held a beer glass.\\n‘What is the big deal?’ I said. It was hardly scandalous to hold a glass of  \\nbeer. Priyanka herself could knock down ten of them if they were free.\\n‘Check out Ganesh’s head,’ Vroom said.\\n‘What/’ I said. I looked closer, and then I saw it.\\n‘Oh no,’ I said, and covered my mouth to keep my voice down.\\nIn the picture, Ganesh had a bald spot in the middle of his head. It was  \\nthe size of the a Happy meal burger and had caught the camera’s flashlight.\\n‘Unbelie…’ I said.\\n‘Shhh!’ Vroom said. ‘Did you see that. He has perfect hair in the statue  \\nof Liberty picture.’\\n‘Are all his photos in this album like this?’ I said.\\n‘Yes sir,’ Vroom said and flicked through the slideshow. One boring  \\npicture after another followed—mainly people with mouths and plates stuffed  \\nwith  food.  Every  picture had  one thing in  common:  whatever there  was  \\nGanesh, there was a shiny spot.\\nVroom pushed his computer mouse away. He reclined back on his chair  \\nwith a proud expression, ‘As I said sir, no one is perfect. Apart from Google,  \\nof course.’\\nI looked at the screen and Vroom’s face in amazement.\\n‘So, now what?’ I said.\\n‘Now we invite the ladies for a viewing,’ Vroom said and grinned.\\n‘No. this is not right…’ I said, but it was too late.\\n‘Esha,  Radhika,  Priyanka. Want to see some more Ganesh pictures?  \\nCome here fast,’ Vroom said.\\nThe girls stopped their phone calls and looked at us. Esha and Radhika  \\nstood up.\\n‘Where, where? Show us,’ Esha said.\\n‘What are you talking about?’ Priyanka said and came over to our side.\\n‘The power of the internet. We found an online album. Come see what  \\nyour new house is like,’ Vroom said.  He kept quiet about the shiny spot so  \\nthat the girls discover it for themselves. I saw the mixture of excitement and  \\ncuriosity in Priyanka’s face.\\n‘Nice pad,’ Esha said, as she notice the barbeque behind the pool, ‘but  \\nwhere is Ganesh. Let me guess,’ she said and brought her finger to the  \\nmonitor. Here, this one no. but wait, he is a baldie. Is he the elder brother?’\\nPriyanka and Radhika looked closer.\\n‘No, that is Ganesh,’ Priyanka said as her mouth opened as wide as the  \\nbald spot. I could sense that the wind had been knocked out of her lungs.\\n‘But I didn’t notice the bald spot in the photo you showed us Priyanka…’  \\nEsha said. Radhika squeezed Esha’s arm. Esha stopped talking and raised her  \\neyebrows.Priyanka came closed to the computer and began flipping through the  \\nimages. She did not realize it, but her hair was falling on my shoulders as she  \\nbent over. It felt nice.\\nHowever, Priyanka was not feeling nice. She brought out the statue of  \\nliberty picture and we looked at it again. Ganesh had perfect hair.\\n‘Maybe the guy in the online album is Ganesh’s elder brother,’ Radhika  \\nsaid.\\n‘No. Ganesh does not have a brother. He only has one sister. Priyanka  \\nsaid, her face distraught.\\nThere was silence for a few seconds.\\n‘Well  doesn’t  really  matter much, eh? What’s  a  bit of  smooth  skin  \\nbetween the true over of two souls,’ Vroom said. I clamped my jaws shut to  \\nprevent a laugh escaping. ‘Let’s go back people, enough of fun. Don’t forget  \\nthe calls,’ Vroom sad.\\nPriyanka retraced her steps in slow motion. She went back to her seat  \\nand took out her mobile phone. She dialed a long number, probably long  \\ndistance. This call was going to be fun, and I wished I could have tapped it.\\n‘Hello Ganesh,’ Priyanka said in a direct voice. ‘Listen, I cannot talk for  \\nlong. I just want to check on something…yes, jus one question…actually I was  \\njust surfing the Internet…’ Priyanka said and got up from her seat. She moved  \\nto the corner of the room and I could not hear her thereafter.\\nI made a few calls and  terrorized a few more Americans. Priyanka  \\nreturned after ten minutes and tossed her cell phone on the desk.\\nEsha jiggled her eyebrows up and down, as if to ask ‘What’s up?’\\n‘It is him in the online pictures,’ Priyanka said. ‘He didn’t have much to  \\nsay. He said his mother asked him to slightly touch up the hair in the Status of  \\nLiberty snap as that would help in the arranged marriage market.’\\n‘Oh no,’ Esha said.\\n‘He apologized several times. He said he was against tampering with the  \\npicture but had to agree when his mother insisted.’\\n‘Can’t he think for himself?’ Esha said.\\n‘Oh God, what am I going to do?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Did the apologies seem genuine?’ Radhika said.\\n‘Yes. I think so. He said he understood how I must feel. He said he was  \\nready to apologize in front of my family as well.’\\n‘Well, then it is okay. What different does it make? You don’t really  \\ncare about him being bald, do you?’ Radhika said.\\n‘Yeah, besides practically all men become bald in a few years anyway.  \\nIt’s not like you can do something about it then,’ Esha said.\\n‘That’s true,’ Priyanka said, in a mellow voice. I could see her relenting,  \\nand I turned to Vroom.\\n‘Yeah, doesn’t matter. Just make sure he wears a cap at the wedding.  \\nUnless  you  want  to  touch  up  all  the  wedding  pictures,’  Vroom  said  and  \\nchuckled. Esha and I looked down to suppress out grins.\\n‘Shut up, Vroom,’ Radhika said.‘Sorry, I am being mean. Honestly, it is no big deal Priyanka. No one is  \\nperfect, we all know that right? So, let’s get back to the calls,’ Vroom said.#35\\nFor the next half hour we focused on one activity—making calls to save  \\nConnexions.\\nAt 6:30 a.m., I went up the main bay. Team leaders huddled around me  \\nas they gave me the news. The incoming calls had shot up already even  \\nthough we had expected the big boost six hours later. Despite turkey dinners.  \\nAmericans were scared out of their wits. Some had called us several times an  \\nhour.\\nVroom and I went to Bakshi’s office with some senior team leaders.  \\nBakshi had arranged an urgent video conference call with the Boston office.  \\nBakshi supported us as we presented the new call data, insights into the call  \\ntraffic, and potential new sources of revenue. After a twenty-minute video  \\ndiscussion, Boston agreed to a two-month reprieve to the layoffs. They also  \\nagreed to evaluate the possibility of sending top team leaders on a short-term  \\nsales assignment to Boston. However, the team leaders would have to present  \\na clear plan over the next for weeks.\\n‘How did we do it man? I never thought it would work,’ I asked Vroom as  \\nwe came out of Bakshi’s office.\\n‘Promise Americans lots of future dollars, and they listen to you. Only a  \\ntwo-month reprieve, but that’s enough for now,’ Vroom said.\\nReassured that Connexions was safe, I returned to my desk. Vroom went  \\noutside to clean the Qualis before the driver woke up. I had told Vroom I  \\nwanted  to  slip  away—no  goodbyes,  no  hugs  and  no  promises  to  meet,  \\nespecially in front of Priyanka Vroom agreed and said he would be ready with  \\nhis bike outside at 6:50 a.m.\\nThe girls stopped their calls at 6:45 a.m. as our shift got over. Everyone  \\nbegan to log out so they could be in time for the Qualis, which would be ready  \\nat the gate at 7:0 a.m.\\n‘I’m so excited. Radhika is moving into my place,’ Esha said as she  \\nswitched off her monitor. She opened her handbag and started re-arranging  \\nthe contents.\\n‘Really?’ I said.\\n‘Yes, I am,’ Radhika said. ‘And Military Uncle is going to recommend a  \\nlawyer friend. I need a good, tough divorce lawyer.’\\n‘Won’t you try to work it out?’ Priyanka said as she collected the sweet  \\nboxes and placed them back in the bag.\\n‘We’ll see. I am in no mood to compromise. And I am not going back to  \\nhi  house  now  for  sure.  Today,  my  mother-in-law  will  make  her  own  \\nbreakfast.’\\n‘And after that, I’m taking her to Chandigarh for the weekend,’ Esha  \\nsaid and smiled.\\nEveryone was busy making plans. I excused myself on the pretext of  \\ngoing to the water cooler for a drink so I could leave the office from there.#36\\nAt 6:47 a.m. I reached the water cooler. I bent towards the tap to take  \\na last drink at the call center.\\nAs I finished, I stood up to find Priyanka behind me.\\n‘Hi,’ she said. ‘Leaving?’\\n‘Oh, hi. Yes, I am going back on Vroom’s bike…’ I said and wiped my  \\nmouth.\\n‘I’ll miss you,’ she said, interrupting me.\\n‘Huh? Where? In the Qualis?’ I said.\\n‘No Shyam, I’ll miss you in general. I’m sorry about the way things  \\nturned out.’\\n‘Don’t be sorry,’ I said, shaking my fingers dry. ‘It is more my fault. I  \\nunderstand that. I acted like a loser…’\\n‘Shyam, you know how Vroom said just because India is poor doesn’t  \\nmean you stop loving it/’ Priyanka said.\\n‘What?’ I blinked at the change of topic. ‘Oh yes. And I agree, it is our  \\ncountry after all…’\\n‘Yes, we love India because it is ours. But, do you know the other  \\nreason why we don’t stop loving it?’\\n‘Why?’\\n‘You don’t because it isn’t completely India’s fault that we are behind.  \\nYes, some of our past leader could have done things differently, but now we  \\nhave the potential and we know it. And as Vroom says, one day we will show  \\nthem.’\\n‘Point  Good  Point,’  I  said.  I  found  it  strange  that  she  should  talk  \\nnationalism  this  early  in  the  morning.  Not  to  mention  during  what  was  \\npossibly our last time together.\\nI nodded and started walking away from her. ‘Anyway, I think Vroom  \\nwill be waiting…’ I said.\\n‘Wait, I am not done,’ she said.\\n‘What?’ I said and stopped to look at her.\\n‘I applied the same logic to something else,’ she said. ‘I thought, this is  \\nthe same as my Shyam, who may not be successful now, but it doesn’t mean  \\nthe doesn’t have the potential. And it sure as hell doesn’t mean I stop loving  \\nhim.’\\nI stood there dumbstruck. This was unexpected. I fumbled for words,  \\nand finally spoke shakily:\\n‘You know what Priyanka? You say these good lines…that even though  \\nall night I tried to hate you, it’s impossible. But I know I should hate you and  \\nthen I should move on. Because I can’t offer you what Mr Microsoft can…’ I  \\nwas speaking hastily out of nervousness and shock.\\n‘Ganesh,’ she interrupted me.\\n‘What?’ I said.\\n‘Ganesh is his name. Not Mr Microsoft,’ she said.‘Yes, whatever,’ I kept talking,, without pausing to breathe. ‘I can’t  \\noffer you what Ganesh can. No way I could ever buy a Lexus. Maybe a Maruti  \\n800 one day, but that’s about it…’\\nShe smiled.\\n‘Really? 800? With or without AC?’ she said.\\n‘Shut up, I am trying to say something deep and you find a funny,’ I  \\nsaid.\\nShe laughed again, though gently. I wiped a tear from my right eye. She  \\nraised her hand and wiped the other tear from my left eye.\\n‘Anyway, it is over between us, Priyanka. And I know it. I should get  \\nover it soon. I know, I know,’ I said, talking more to myself.\\nShe waited until I had composed myself. I bent over to splash my face  \\nwith water at the cooler.\\n‘Anyway, where is your wedding? Your mom will probably blow all her  \\ncash for a big gig,’ I said, straightening up.\\n‘Some five-star hotel, I am sure. She’ll be paying off loans for years, but  \\nshe has to get a gold-plated stage that night. You’ll come, right?’\\n‘I don’t know,’ I said.\\n‘What do you mean you don’ know? It’ll be so strange if you aren’t  \\nthere.’\\n‘I  don’t  want  to  come  there  and  feel  horrible.  Anyway,  what’s  so  \\nstrange if I am not there?’\\n‘Well, it’s little strange if the groom is not there at his own wedding,’  \\nPriyanka said.\\nI froze as I heard the words. I rewound her last sentence three times in  \\nmy head.\\n‘What, what did you just say?’ I said.\\nShe pinched my cheek and imitated me: ‘What, what did you just say?’\\nI just stood there shocked.\\n‘But don’t think I am going to let you go that easy. One day I want my  \\n800 with AC,’ she said and laughed.\\n‘What?’ I said.\\n‘You heard me. I want to marry you, Shyam,’ Priyanka said.\\nI could not believe her words. I though I would jump in joy, but mostly I  \\nwas shocked. And even though I wanted to hug, cry and laugh at the same  \\ntime, a firm voice asked like a guard inside me.  What was this all about ? \\nHell, however miserable my life was, I didn’t want pity .\\n‘What are you saying Priyanka? You will choose me over Ganesh? Is this  \\na sympathy decision?’\\n‘Stop  thinking  about  yourself.  My  life’s  biggest  decision  can’t  be  a  \\nsympathy decision. I have thought about it. Ganesh is great, but…’\\n‘But what?’ I said.\\n‘But the whole touching up of the photo bothers me. He is an achiever  \\non his own. So why did he have to lie?’‘You are rejecting him because he is bald? My hair isn’t reliable either,’  \\nI said. It was true. Every time I took a shower, the towel had more time than  \\nme.\\n‘No. I am not rejecting him because he is bald. Most men go bald one  \\nday,, it is horrible, I know,’ she said and ruffled my hair. She continued: ‘He  \\nmight be fine in most ways, but the point is, he lied. And this gives me a clue  \\nabout the person he is. I don’t want to spend my life with a person like that.  \\nIn  fact,  I  don’t  want  to  spend  my  life  with  a  person  I  don’t  know  well  \\nbeforehand. That is one part of my decision. There is the other big part.’\\n‘What/’ I said.\\n‘That I love you. Because you are the only person in the world I can be  \\nmyself with. And because you are the only person who knows me with all my  \\nflaws and still loves me completely. I hope,’ she said, with a quivering voice.\\nI did not say anything.\\nShe spoke again: ‘And even if the world says I am cold, there is a part of  \\nme that is sentimental, irrational and romantic. Do I really care about money?  \\nOnly because people tell me I should. Hell, I prefer truck driver dhabhas over  \\nfive-star hotels. Shyam, I know mom and you say I am uncaring…’\\n‘I never said that…’ I said and held her shoulders.\\n‘I’m sorry, Shyam. I judged you so much. I am such a bitch,’ Priyanka  \\nsaid.\\nShe sniffed. Her puckered nose looked cuter than it ever had.\\n‘It’s okay Priyanka,’ I said and wiped her tears.\\n‘So that is it, Shyam. Deep inside, I am just a girl who wants to be with  \\nher favourite boy. Because like you, this girl is a person who needs a lot of  \\nlove.’\\n‘Love?’ I need a lot of love?’ I said.\\n‘Of course, you do. And everyone else does too.; funny we never say it.  \\nIt is okay to scream in public if you are hungry “ I’m starving”. It is okay to  \\nmake a fuss if you are tired “ I’m so sleepy”. But somehow we cannot say “I  \\njust need some more love”. Why can’t we say it, Shyam? It is as basic a need.’\\nI looked at her. Whenever she gives these deep, philosophical lines, I  \\nget horribly attracted to her. The guard inside reminded me, ‘ Be firm’.\\n‘Priyanka?’\\n‘Yes, she said, still sniffling.\\n‘I love you,’ I said.\\n‘I love you too,’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Thanks. However…Priyanka, I can’t marry you. Sorry to say this, but my  \\nanswer to your mind-blowing proposal is no,’ I said.\\n‘What?’ Priyanka said as her eyes opened wide in disbelief. The guard  \\ninside me was in full charge.\\n‘No. I cannot marry you. I am a new person tonight. And this new person  \\nneeds to make a new life and find new respect for himself. You chose Ganesh,  \\nand he is fine. You have an option for a new life. You don’t really need me. So  \\nmaybe it is better this way,’ I said.‘I still love you Shyam, and only you. Please don’t do this…’ she said and  \\ncame closer to me.\\n‘Sorry,’ I said and moved back three steeps. ‘I can’t. I am not your spare  \\nwheel. I appreciate you coming back, but I think I am ready to move on.’\\nShe just stood there and cried. My heart felt weak, but my head was  \\nstrong.\\n‘Bye Priyanka ,’ I gingerly patted her shoulder and left.#37\\n‘What the hell kept you?’ Vroom said, as he sat on his bike and the main  \\nentrance. He showed his watch to me, it was 6:59 a.m.\\n‘Sorry man, Priyanka met me at the water cooler,’ I said and sank onto  \\nthe pillion seat.\\n‘And?’ Vroom said.\\n‘Nothing. Just goodbye and all. Oh, and she wanted to get back—marry  \\nme, she said. Can you believe it?’\\nVroom turned to me.\\n‘Really? What did you say?’\\n‘I said no,’ I said coolly.\\n‘What?’ Vroom said.\\nAs we were talking, Radhika, Esha and Military Uncle came out of the  \\nmain entrance into the wintry sunshine.\\n‘Hi, you guys still here?’ Radhika said.\\n‘Shyam just said no to Priyanka. She wanted to marry him,’ but he said  \\nno.’\\n‘What/’ Radhika and Esha spoke unison.\\n‘Hey guys, chill out. I did what I needed to do to get some respect in my  \\nlife. Quit bothering me,’ I said.\\nThe Qualis driver bothering me,’ I said.\\n‘We aren’t bothering you. It’s your life—let’s go Esha,’ Radhika said and  \\ngave me a dirty look. She turned to Esha as they walked to the Qualis.\\n‘Where’s Priyanka madam? We are getting late,’ the driver said.\\n‘She’s coming. She is on the phone with her mother. Ganesh’s parents  \\nare coming home for breakfast. Her mother is making hot paranthas,’ Radhika  \\nsaid, loud enough so I could hear. The mention of paranthas made me hungry.  \\nBut I guess I would be the last person to be invited to this breakfast.\\n‘Looks like their entire families are getting married to each other,’  \\nVroom said. He lit a cigarette to take a few final puffs before we began our  \\nride back.\\nThe driver started the Qualis. Esha and Radhika sat in the middle row,  \\nwhile Military Uncle sat behind.\\nPriyanka came running our of the main entrance. She avoided me and  \\nwent straight to the Qualis front seat. The driver turned the Qualis so its rear  \\nend faced us.\\nAs the Qualis began to move, Military Uncle looked out from his window  \\nand said something. I could only make out in lip sync. ‘You bloody idiot…’ I  \\nthought it was.\\nBefore I could react, the Qualis was gone.\\nVroom stubbed out his cigarette.\\n‘Oh no. I am a bloody idiot. I let her go,’ I said.\\n‘Uh-huh,’ Vroom said as he wore his helmet.\\n‘Is that a yes? You think I am a total idiot?’‘You are your best judge,’ Vroom said as he dragged the bike with his  \\nfeet.\\n‘Vroom, what have I done? If she reaches home and has paranthas with  \\nGanesh’s family, it is all over. I am such a moron,’ I said and started jumping  \\nup and down on my seat.\\n‘Stop dancing around. I have to ride,’ Vroom said s he placed his foot on  \\nthe kick-pedal.\\n‘Vroom, we have to catch the Qualis. Can you ride fast enough to catch  \\nit?’\\nVroom removed his helmet laughed.\\n‘Are you insulting me? You are doubting that I can catch that wreck of a  \\nQualis? I am hurt, man.’\\n‘Vroom, let’s go. Please,’  said and pushed his shoulders.\\n‘No. first you apologize for doubting my driving abilities.’\\n‘I am sorry, boss, I am sorry,’ I said and folded my hands. ‘Now move,  \\nSchumacher.’\\nVroom kick-started his bike. In a few seconds, we had zipped out of the  \\ncall center. The main road was getting busier in the morning, but Vroom still  \\nmanaged ninety an hour. We dodged cars, scooters, autos, school buses and  \\nnewspaper hawkers as we took the road to Delhi.\\nFour minutes later, I noticed a Qualis at a distant traffic signal.\\n‘It must be that one,’ I pointed out.\\nJust as Vroom moved ahead, a herd of goats decided to cross the road.  \\nThere were fifty of them, blocking our way.\\n‘Damn, where did they come from?’ I said, nervous as hell.\\n‘Gurgaon was a village until recently; the goats are probably asking  \\nwhere did we come from,’ Vroom said as he cracked his knuckles.\\n‘Shut up and do something,’ I said.\\nVroom tried to move his bike, but he only bumped into a goat’s horns.  \\nHe considered taking the right side of the road with traffic going the other  \\nway—but it was full of trucks that would kill us in five seconds.\\n‘There is only one option,’ Vroom said and smiled at me through the  \\nhelmet.\\n‘Wha…’ I was saying when Vroom lunged his bike up on the road divider.\\n‘Are you crazy?’ I said.\\n‘No, you are crazy to let her go,’ Vroom said and started riding on the  \\ndivider. Te goats and traffic looked at us in shock. Vroom dodged through the  \\nstreet lights, until we had crossed the herd. Once back on the road, Vroom  \\nsped up to a hundred. A minute later, our bike met the Qualis at a red light. I  \\ngot off the bike and tapped the front window. Priyanka looked away. I banged  \\nthe glass with my palm.\\nShe opened the window. ‘What is it? We don’t want to buy anything,’  \\nPriyanka said, as if I was a roadside vendor.\\n‘I am an idiot,’ I said.\\n‘And?’ Priyanka said.Everyone in the Qualis rolled down their windows to look at me.\\n‘I am a moron. I am stupid and insane and nuts. Please I want to marry  \\nyou.’\\n‘Oh really? What about the new man needing respect?’ Priyanka said.\\n‘I didn’t know what I was saying. What does one do with respect? I can’t  \\nkeep it in my pocket,’ I said.\\n‘So you want to keep me in your pocket/’ Priyanka said.\\n‘You are already in every pocket—of my life, my heart, my mind, my  \\nsoul—please comeback. Will you come back?’ I said, as the red light turned  \\nyellow.\\n‘Hmm. Let’s see…’ Priyanka said.\\n‘Priyanka, please answer fast.’\\n‘I don’t know. Let me think. Meet me at the next red light okay? Let’s  \\ngo Driver ji,’ she said as the light turned green. The driver, as if enjoying my  \\nmisery, took off at full speed.\\n‘What did she say?’ Vroom said as I sat on the bike.\\n‘She’ll answer at the next red light. Let’s go.’\\nThere was a mini-=traffic jam at the next red light. I got off the bike  \\nand ran past a few vehicles to reach the Qualis. I tapped the window again.  \\nPriyanka wasn’t there.\\n‘Where is she?’ I asked the driver. He shrugged his shoulders. \\nI looked inside the Qualis. Radhika and Esha shrugged their shoulders;  \\nshe wasn’t in there.\\nSomeone came up from behind and hugged me.\\n‘I told you we didn’t want to buy anything. Why are you bothering us?’\\nI turned around to look at Priyanka.\\n‘I don’t know what I was doing at the water cooler,’ I said.\\n‘Shut up and hug me,’ Priyanka said and opened her arms.\\nOur eyes met, and even though I wanted to speak a lot, our eyes did al  \\nthe talking. I hugged her for a few seconds, and then she kissed me. Our lips  \\nlocked, and every passenger stuck in the traffic jam looked at us, enjoying  \\nthe early morning show. It was awkward to kiss in this setting, but I could not  \\nextract myself from her. We were kissing after six months, and there was a  \\nlot of pent-up demand. Vroom and everyone else from the Qualis surrounded  \\nus. Soon, they began to clap and whistle. The vehicles on the road joined in  \\nwith their horns in sync with the applause. But I could not see them or hear  \\nthem. Al I could see was Priyanka, and all I could hear was my inner voice that  \\nsaid—kiss her, kiss her and kiss her some more.#38\\nWell guys, that is how that night, and my story ends. We did not know  \\nwhat, how or when things would happen in the future. And to some extent,  \\nwe still don’t know. But that is what life is like—uncertain, screwed up at  \\ntimes, but still fun. However, let me tell you where we were one month after  \\nthis night. Vroom and I started this website design company with the seed  \\ncapital  that  Bakshi  gave  us.  We  called  it  the  Black  Sheep  Web  Design  \\nCompany. In a month, we had only managed to get one local order. It helped  \\nus break even or even show a profit—depending on whether Vroom charged  \\nthe cigarettes to the company or not. No international orders yet, but we  \\nshall see.\\nEsha quit her modeling aspirations and continued to work at the call  \\ncenter. However, she works with this NGO during the day. Her job is to  \\nfundraise  with  corporate.  I  heard  she  is  doing  well.  I  guess  when  male  \\nexecutives hear such a hot woman ask for money for a good cause, they  \\ncannot say no. most of them are probably staring at her navel ring when they  \\nare signing the cheque. Apart from that, Vroom asked her out on a coffee  \\nsemi-date (whatever that means) for next week and I think she said yes. \\nMilitary Uncle got a visa for the US and went to make amends with his  \\nson. He has not come back, so things must be working out. Radhika is fighting  \\nher divorce case with her husband, and has moved in with Esha. She is also  \\nplanning to visit her parents for a while. Anuj has apologized, but Radhika is  \\nin no mood to relent yet.\\nPriyanka works at Connexions as well, but in six months she will go to  \\ncollege for an accelerated one0-year B.Ed. We decided that marriage is at  \\nleast two years away. Right now, we meet often but the first focus is career.  \\nHer mother faked three heart attacks when Priyanka said no to Ganesh, but  \\nPriyanka yawned every single time until her mom gave up on the heart attack  \\nfront and closed the Ganesh file.\\nSo looks like things are working out. As for me as a person, I still feel  \\nthe same for the most part. However, there is a difference. I used to feel I  \\nwas a good-for-nothing non-achiever. But that is not true. After all, I helped  \\nsave lots of jobs at a call center, taught my boss a lesson, started my own  \\ncompany, was chosen over a big-catch NRI groom by a wonderful girl and now  \\nI even finished a whole book. this means that i) I can do whatever I really  \\nwant ii) God is always with me and iii) there is no such thing as a loser after  \\nall.EPILOGUE \\n_____________\\n‘Wow,’ I said, some story that was.’ She nodded. And had a sip of water  \\nfrom her bottle. She held the bottle tight to prevent the water from spilling  \\nover in the moving train.\\n‘Thank you,’ I said, ‘it made our night go by pretty quickly.’\\nI checked the time; it was close to 7 a.m. Our journey was almost over.  \\nDelhi was les than an hour away. The train was tearing through the night, and  \\ndeep into the horizon, I could see a streak of saffron light up the sky.\\n‘So, you liked it?’\\n‘Yes, it was fun. But also, it made me think. I want through a similar  \\nphase like Shyam, at work and in my personal life. I wish I had known this  \\nstory then. It might have made me do things differently, or at least would  \\nhave made me feel less bad.’\\n‘There you go. It is one of those rare stories that is fun but can help you  \\nas well. And that is why I am asking you to share it. You ready to make it into  \\na book?’ she said, replacing the cap on the water bottle.\\n‘I guess. It will take your time though,’ I said.\\n‘For sure. And I will give you all the people’s details. Feel for to contact  \\ntem if you want. Through which of them will you tell the story?’\\n‘Shyam. Like I said, he and his story are a lot like mine. I relate to him a  \\nlot; I had similar problems. My own dark side.’\\n‘Really? That’s interesting,’ she said. ‘It is true through, we all have a  \\ndark side—something we don’t like about ourselves, something that makes us  \\nangry and something we want to change about ourselves. The difference is  \\nhow we choose to face it.’\\nI nodded. The train rocked in a soothing, gentle motion. We were silent  \\nuntil I spoke after a few minutes.\\n‘Listen, sorry to say this. There it one issue I think readers may have  \\nwith this story.’\\n‘What?’\\n‘The conversation with God.’\\nShe smiled.\\n‘What’s the issue with that,’ she said.\\n‘Well, just that—some people may not buy it. One has to present reality  \\nin a story. Readers always say, “tell me what really happened”. So in the  \\ncontext, how is this “God calling” going to fit in?’\\n‘Why? You don’t think that can happen?’ she said shifting in her seat.  \\nHer blanket moved, uncovering a book I had not noticed before.\\n‘Well, I don’t know. It obviously does not happen a lot. I mean, things  \\nneed to have a rational, scientific explanation.’\\n‘Really? Does everything in life work that way?’\\n‘I guess?’‘Well, let’s see. You said you did not know why, but you could really  \\nrelate to Shyam. What’s the scientific and rational explanation for that?’\\nI thought for a few moments but could not think of a suitable answer.\\nShe saw me fidgeting and looked amused.\\n‘Please try and understand,’ I said. ‘Calls from God don’t happen a lot.  \\nHow can I write about that?’\\n‘Okay, listen. I am going to give you an alternative to the ‘God’s phone  \\ncall” bit. A rational one, okay?’ she said and kept her bottle away.\\n‘What alternative?’ I said.\\n‘Let’s rewind a bit. So they drove into a pit and the Qualis it trapped,  \\nsuspended by rods, right? You okay with that part?’\\n‘Right. I can live with that,’ I said.\\n‘And then they felt the end was near. There was no hope in life—\\nliterally and figuratively. Agreed?’\\n‘Agreed,’ I said.\\n‘Okay,’ she continued, ‘so let’s just say that, at that moment, Military  \\nUncle spoke up. He said “I noticed you guys are in an unusual situation here,  \\nso I thought I should intervene and give you some advice”.’\\n‘That’s exactly what God said,’ I said.\\n‘Correct. And from that point on, whatever God said, you can substitute  \\nas if Military Uncle said it. He told them about success, the inner call and all  \\nthose other things.’\\n‘Really? Is that what happened?’ I said.\\n‘No. I did not say that. I just said you have the option to do that; so that  \\neverything appears more scientific, more rational. You understand my point?’\\n‘Yes,’ I said.\\n‘So, you choose whichever version you want in the main story. It will,  \\nafter all, be your story.’\\nI nodded.\\n‘But can I ask you one question?’\\n‘Sure,’ I said.\\n‘Which of the two is a better story?’\\nI thought for a second.\\n‘The one with God in it,’ I said.\\n‘Just like life. Rational or not, it just gets better with God in it.’\\nI reflected on her words for a few minutes. She became silent. I looked  \\nat her face she looked even better in the light of dawn.\\n‘Well, looks like Delhi is coming son,’ she said and looked out. The fields  \\nhad ended, and we could see the houses of Delhi’s border villages.\\n‘Yeah, the trip is over,’ I said. ‘Thanks for everything—err, let me guess,  \\nEsha right?’ I stood up to shake her hand.\\n‘Esha? Why did you think I was her?’\\n‘Because you are so good–looking.’\\n‘Thanks,’ she laughed, ‘but sorry, I am not Esha.’\\n‘So? Priyanka?’ I said.\\n‘No.’‘Don’t tell me—Radhika?’\\n‘No, I am not Radhika either,’ she said.\\n‘Well then…who are you?’\\nShe just smiled.\\nThat is when it struck me. She was a girl, she knew the full story, but  \\nshe was not Esha, Priyanka or Radhika. Which meant there was only one  \\nalternative left.\\n‘So…that means…oh my…’ My whole body shook as I found it difficult to  \\nbalance. I felt down on my knees. Her face shone, and bright sunlight entered  \\nour compartment in one stroke.\\nI looked up at her as she smiled. She had an open book next to her. It  \\nwas the English translation of a holy text. My eyes focused on a few lines on  \\nthe page that lay open:\\nAlways think of Me, become My devotes, worship Me and offer your  \\nhomage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I Promise you this  \\nbecause you are My very dear friend.\\n‘What,’ I said as I felt my head spin. Maybe the sleepless night was  \\ncatching up. But she just smiled and smiled. She raised her hand and kept in  \\non my head.\\n‘I don’t know that to say,’ I said in the blinding light.\\nA sense of tiredness engulfed me as the sleepless night took its toll. I  \\nclosed my eyes.\\nWhen I opened them, the train had stopped, and I knelt on the floor  \\nwith my head down. The train was at Delhi Station. The cacophony of porters,  \\ntea sellers and passenger movement rang in my ears. I slowly looked up at her  \\nseat—but she was gone.\\n‘Sir, will you get out on your own or do you need help,’ a porter tapped  \\nmy shoulder.\\n FINISH'"
